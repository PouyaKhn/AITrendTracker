    "text": "Danmarks position inden for rumforskning skal fastholdes, og derfor bruger Aalborg Universitet nu 530 millioner kroner på at bygge nye kontorer, værksteder og laboratorier til de studerende og forskerne. Det skriver universitetet i en pressemeddelelse. Langt de fleste af pengene skal gå til at renovere og ombygge eksisterende faciliteter, mens der for 80 millioner kroner skal bygges nyt. Det hele samles i det såkaldte Tech Lab, der i alt kommer til at rumme 19.000 kvadratmeter. Det nye byggeri ventes at stå færdig i 2028, mens renoveringen ventes afsluttet i 2029. Udover at samle rumforskningen i Tech Lab bliver der blandt andet også plads til en flyvergård til droner. Pengene til projekterne kommer fra Aalborg Universitet, Bygningsstyrelsen og de såkaldte Unilab-midler.",

    "text": "Der skal investeres store milliard-beløb i den digitale infrastruktur, hvis ikke Europa skal læsses af det globale kapløb og lades agterud af USA og Kina. Sådan lyder det fra DI, som sammen med Boston Consulting Group på baggrund af en ny rapport konkluderer, at situationen i Europa er 'kritisk.' \"Vi mangler investeringer for hele 270 milliarder euro frem mod 2040, hvis regionen [Europa, red] skal matche tempoet og ambitionsniveauet i den digitale globale konkurrence,\" lyder det fra DI. Problemet for Europa er, at Kina og USA for tiden investerer massivt i udbygning af den digitale infrastruktur. Og det kommer til at ramme Europa, hvis ikke den europæiske telesektor følger med. Ifølge DI hæmmes de danske og europæiske investeringer i telesektoren af \"høj fragmentering, tunge reguleringsbyrder og utidssvarende regulering,\" som det hedder. Branchedirektør i DI, Andreas Holbak Espersen, peger på, at Europa risikerer at blive hægtet helt af den digitale udvikling. \"Det nytter ikke noget, at vi har huller i vores digitale landevej, når USA og Kina bygger femsporede motorveje og lægger fundamentet for fremtidens digitale økonomi. Vi er udfordret af et fragmenteret marked og en lang række sektorspecifikke regler, der i praksis hæmmer investeringerne,\" siger han. Samtidig er også antallet af store operatører, som konkurrerer med hinanden, en hæmsko, da det skaber et meget fragmenteret marked. I Europa er der for tiden 34 mobiloperatører. I Danmark alene er der fire. Ifølge DI er der til sammenligning blot 'tre til fire' mobiloperatører i Kina og USA. \"Rammevilkårene skal følge med tiden og vores digitale ambitioner. Der er hårdt brug for regelforenkling. Et voksende antal administrative byrder er en alvorlig hæmsko for udviklingen i telesektoren. Samtidig er det nødvendigt, at vi reducerer fragmenteringen i det indre marked og skaber bedre muligheder for konsolidering,\" siger Andreas Holbach Espersen.",

    "title": "Why medical students are choosing Bulgaria over united kingdom ",
    "text": "Why medical students are choosing Bulgaria over UK A growing number of young people are choosing to study in Eastern Europe due to a strict cap on medical school places in the UK. Freya Mandapalli from Preston is one of them. The 19-year-old has healthcare in her blood. Her parents both work at the local hospital and her older sister studied medicine at Edinburgh and now works as a doctor. \"I just got inspired by her really,\" Freya said. But getting into a medical school in the UK generally requires a minimum of three As at A-level and high grades in other subjects and Freya struggled to get them. Although she got interviews, she didn't receive any offers. She considered a gap year but then a family friend mentioned the possibility of studying in Plovdiv, in Southern Bulgaria. \"I was really nervous to start with, but the city's beautiful and I've found some great friends,\" added Freya, who has just started her second year of a medical degree. In England around 8,126 medical students started this academic year, just over a thousand of them in the North West. This is sharply up from two years ago when it was just 7,010 but still far short of the 15,000 the government says it needs for England by 2031 to meet demand. But with the cap on medical school places, it means competition to get one is intense, and many students are voting with their feet. 'Word of mouth' Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton has just started his fifth year at the same university in Plovdiv. He too found the course through word of mouth. \"One of my friends told me that his brother already studies within Bulgaria and he was planning on going himself,\" he said. \"My mother was very worried, my father wanted me to stay strong and be independent, but the rest of my family didn't know what to expect. But those worries gradually subsided.\" The Medical University of Plovdiv is one of Bulgaria's most prestigious medical schools and attracts many more applicants than it admits. Although it does ask for academic qualifications, a large part of the admissions process hangs on an entrance exam. Veselina Goranova, vice rector for Education, says their students' home countries include Greece, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Canada, the US – but added the biggest group by far, \"about 40% come from the UK\". That may be in part because classes for international students are held in English but also because a well-established network of agencies now exist to help those hoping to make the leap. Dr Muhammad Hamza from Blackburn graduated from Plovdiv last year and is currently back there helping to settle new students. He works with MedConnect Europe Ltd, an agency headquartered in London but with offices around Eastern Europe. He says the agency helps new students navigate the complications of a new life abroad like finding a flat, dealing with paperwork, and sorting out life's essentials. \"We get them in touch with the estate agents, we book the flights for them. Our representatives will be there at the airport to collect them, take them to the hotels,\" he said. Strict timetable \"We help them with shopping – buying bedding, cutlery..wifi, mobile sims, setting them up. Because they don't know the language and we have representatives in each country which do know the language it becomes so much easier,\" he added. Dr Hamza spends most of his time working as a private dentist in Chorley, where he spends a year with a mentor. The firm, he says, came out to Plovdiv to recruit dentists there. \"It's probably because of the vast practical experience we get in Bulgaria,\" he said, adding that the Bulgarian system requires students to complete large numbers of relatively complex procedures. \"So going and starting as a dentist in the UK, I already had somewhat of a solid foundation.\" New students need to get used to a strict timetable which often begins at 7.30am and may not finish until 6pm. They also need to study Bulgarian so they can talk to the patients they will be treating in the last three years of their course. Bulgarian, like Russian, uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and a complex grammar structure. Milena Muleshkova is one of those tasked with getting the students up to scratch. She says that first year is about everyday communication, while the second-year concentrates on medical terms. Medical courses in Bulgaria last six years, one year longer than in the UK but common in mainland Europe. At the end of it, successful students have a degree which is recognised by the General Medical Council in England, and which allows them to practice in the NHS without any further tests. BBC World Service: Why are medical students going to Bulgaria? This may change though in 2028 when Britain next looks at its agreements with the EU. And another potential change is particularly worrying some students. The NHS has become increasingly reliant on attracting healthcare staff from overseas to meet increasing patient demand. In 2023 68% of doctors joining the NHS were international medical graduates (IMGs) and the number has been rising year on year. Currently the NHS treats applicants from overseas and the UK in the same way for jobs and training opportunities. This has become an increasingly contentious issue for resident (formerly known as junior) doctors in England who say many at the beginning of their career are being denied the opportunity to progress. Earlier this month they voted to strike over the shortage of speciality training places. But the doctors' union the British Medical Association wants UK graduates to be prioritised for those training posts. Health Secretary Wes Streeting says he agrees. But this could mean British students studying abroad would also be looked at less favourably because they would also be classed as IMGs. 'It's quite scary' Mohammed Adnaan Patel said he did have sympathy with much of the argument but not all. He said: \"It's quite a topic of frequent discussion as the years go on as we get closer to that stage,\" \"It is quite scary. It does raise a lot of anxiety within the students and myself.\" But the NHS also has difficulty keeping hold of medical staff. Last year in the North West of England one in ten left - although that was actually better than the year before. Some will have left the profession altogether but some will have been tempted away by similar jobs in Canada, Australia, and the gulf states, who also run international recruitment campaigns. As the global population ages and healthcare needs increase, the international fight to attract trained medical staff, wherever they come from, is likely to intensify. Dr Muhammad Hamza from MedConnect Europe says he doesn't see the demand for European students slowing any time soon. He said: \"I see it growing because the demand for doctors and dentists, not only in the UK is a lot but all over the world\" \"I don't see it slowing down. It's going to expand further and further.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "title": "The lecturers learning to spot AI misconduct",
    "text": "The lecturers learning to spot AI misconduct With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and more students turning to technology in their studies, academics have a complex challenge on their hands. University bosses at De Montfort University (DMU) are trying to strike a tricky balance between encouraging students to use AI ethically and preventing them from gaining an unfair advantage. But with AI getting \"better and better\", it is \"becoming increasingly difficult to spot\", according to Dr Abiodun Egbetokun, associate professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at DMU. Lecturers there are now being given guidance, as well as face-to-face training sessions, on how to spot the signs of wrongful AI use among students. \"We're still in the take-off stage [of AI],\" said Dr Egbetokun, who is researching generative AI in higher education. \"There are more and more academics and students making use of different AI tools for different purposes,\" he said. Dr Egbetokun said the use of AI was hard to spot due to its \"increasing capabilities\" but academics were getting better at looking for \"specific markers\" such as a high repetition of the same word or Americanisms. However, AI use is not only allowed for students at De Montfort University, it is encouraged, as long as it is used properly. \"Our role as educators has to be to encourage students to think critically about AI,\" said Shushma Patel, pro vice-chancellor for artificial intelligence at DMU. She said the university's AI policy stated students could use AI to \"support their thinking\" or help them \"fill in the blanks\" when tasks were not clear, but they must demonstrate how they used it. Mrs Patel said if a student submitted AI-generated material \"as their own\" or used it to \"invent\" references, it was classed as misconduct and they could face a disciplinary panel. Jennifer Hing, academic practice officer, added: \"The biggest thing to remember is, is it your work? Is it your words? If it is not, then you've crossed a line.\" Mrs Hing, who sits on misconduct panels, said the majority of AI misuse among students was accidental due to \"a lack of skill or knowledge, or confidence\". Brett Koenig, associate head of education in business and law, has attended DMU's sessions looking at how to spot wrongful AI use. He said he did sometimes get a \"gut feeling\" when the technology had been used wrongfully, but the training had helped him to look for specific markers, such as certain punctuation. \"It's an indication if it's 50 or 60 references to [the word] 'fostering', for example, that it may have been generated by artificial intelligence. \"It's not to say that's cheating, and it's not to say that's plagiarism because people use that word - but that seems to be a popular word with ChatGPT,\" he said. DMU is not the only UK institution embracing the technology, with students and staff at the University of Oxford now having access to ChatGPT Edu - the education version of artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT. A recent survey of thousands of students across the globe also found many used artificial intelligence to assist their studies, but also feared it could affect their future careers. Dr Ruth McKie, senior lecturer in criminology at DMU, said it was important to \"acknowledge the realities within society\" that AI was now a \"necessary tool\". The lecturer said there was an understanding academics \"need to be trained to catch people that use AI with the assumption that they are cheating in some way\". \"We need to start figuring out why [it's been used], we can't just automatically assume that they've used it for the easy route out,\" she said. Staff at DMU also said they had reservations about some AI detection software. \"I put some work through an AI checker just to see what it comes up with and most of the time it says all of it is AI-generated, and I know that's rubbish,\" said Dr McKie. The 34-year-old said a friend put their PHD thesis through an AI checker just to see the outcome. It said \"it was 100% AI\", despite him using \"no AI whatsoever\", Dr McKie added. Mr Koenig said this was why the technology was not being used widely by lecturers. \"It's as damaging to a student to falsely accuse them [of wrongful AI misuse] as it is to accurately say that they have committed plagiarism. \"So, it's our job to move with the times rather than just try to catch them out,\" he said. DMU engineering student Yassim Hijji, 19, who speaks English as his third language, said he used AI in lectures to help him with more complex words or phrases. \"Sometimes I write the message in my language, which is Italian or Arabic, and then I ask it to translate it to English,\" he said. \"If it helps you to get better then why not use it? It's like using a book at the end of the day.\" Nursing student Jodie Hurt, 37, said there was \"definitely a place\" for the technology as it could be used in her industry to \"help protect\" nurses and patients. \"There are tools that can be used in general practice that will help document a consultation between a nurse and a patient,\" she said. However, Lucy Harrigan - who also studies nursing - said there was a clear line when it came to using AI. \"You can't copy and paste, you can't use it as a reliable source,\" she said. The 36-year-old said it was \"massive misconduct\" to submit AI-generated work as your own. \"It's not showing your knowledge, you've got to earn your degree,\" she added.

    "title": "  UK biggest maps enthusiast  has collection of 2 , 000",
    "text": "'UK's biggest maps enthusiast' has collection of 2,000 - he may buy more Nigel Brown has built up a collection of nearly 2,000 Ordnance Survey maps over 60 years - but he admits he will probably still buy some more. As a 10-year-old, he and a group of friends got hold of one, spotted a well marked on it, and set off to find it - successfully. That childhood adventure sparked a lifelong fascination with maps, exploration and the changing landscapes that they capture. It has also just seen Nigel - from Ashkirk in the Borders - named the UK's biggest map enthusiast in a competition organised by Ordnance Survey. His extraordinary collection spans centuries, with his oldest map dating back more than 200 years. Most of his maps have been discovered in antique shops and car boot sales, and many have accompanied him on holidays to help plan walking routes and uncover hidden gems. What began as a hobby has now earned national recognition. Nigel entered Ordnance Survey's nationwide search for Britain's biggest map lover \"just for a bit of fun\", never expecting to win. \"I never for one moment thought I'd come away with the title, but it's been lovely,\" he said. His home is now a haven for cartographic history. The maps are meticulously organised in drawers and chests throughout the house, with some of the oldest ones framed on the walls. It was not until he moved to the Scottish Borders four years ago that the sheer scale of his collection became apparent. However, that has not stopped it from growing. In fact, winning the title has only encouraged it. \"Funnily enough, since I won the award, I've had all sorts of people offering me more maps,\" he said. Despite the rise of digital navigation, Nigel remains loyal to paper maps. He still uses them regularly on walks around the Borders, with the Ordnance Survey app being the closest thing to a sat-nav he owns. UK holidays are carefully planned with the help of his vast collection - with Shetland being a favourite destination. \"It takes the top spot,\" he said. \"It's a wee bit far away, but well worth it.\" Even after six decades of collecting, Nigel's passion for maps and exploration shows no signs of fading. \"You look at these old maps and see place names and landmarks that no longer exist - it's fascinating,\" he said. Now recognised for his efforts, Nigel said the award had made him reflect on the scale of what he had built. \"I'll probably still buy one or two if I see them,\" he admitted. \"But I might have to start thinking about offloading a few.\"",

    "title": "Orionid meteor shower : how stargazers can get the best views in Australia",
    "text": "Early rising stargazers in Australia will be in prime position to catch a glimpse of the Orionid meteor shower, which will this week pass through our atmosphere. Those who tend to wake before dawn will have the best chance of seeing the shower. For those who miss it, there’s still the biggest meteor event of the year yet to come – the Geminid meteor shower. Here’s what you need to know about the Orionid meteor shower and where you can see it from around the country if you’re up in time. What is the Orionid meteor shower? Jonti Horner, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland, says the Orionids are the result of the dust and debris left behind by Halley’s comet. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “This dust and debris is spread out a bit in space and it means that essentially there is this giant tube of dust through the solar system and it’s pretty wide now and it takes the Earth about a month to pass through it,” Horner says. “When the Earth reaches that location in our orbit, we will run into this dust and so we’ll get the meteor shower. And that’s what makes it an annual meteor shower.” This year’s meteor shower will peak this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday. When can you see it in Australia? If you want to catch a glimpse of the Orionids, you’ll need to set an alarm to make sure you’re up in the early hours. For people in the Brisbane area, the radiant for the Orionids isn’t rising until about 10.30pm at night. In Sydney, the Orionids shower isn't appearing high in the sky until close to midnight, Horner says Blood moon and lunar eclipse shines around the world – video He says the Orionids’ radiant will be at its highest in the sky for about 30 minutes, from roughly 4-4.30am (AEDT). But the best chance of viewing it is about an hour before and after it is at its highest point. “If I was getting up for them … I would look at setting my alarm for maybe 2.30am [3.30am AEDT] and watching through until about 4.30am [5.30am],” Horner says. “This is when I would be looking to get the best view.” At this time of night – even with the best conditions and clear skies – stargazers may only see about 10 to 15 meteors an hour, he says. Why do meteor showers happen? Horner says a meteor is simply a bit of dust and debris crashing into the Earth’s atmosphere, at a speed between 12km and 72km a second. “When you see a shooting star, you’re seeing something smaller than a grain of rice typically hitting the Earth’s atmosphere at a very high speed and burning powerfully way overhead,” Horner says. “The solar system is littered with this kind of dust and debris, which means that you’ve got meteors popping off all the time.” What else can stargazers look forward to? A bigger event is the Geminid meteor shower, which will peak on the night of 14 December. “The Geminids are the best meteor shower of the year by far – and that’s worldwide,” Horner says. “They are slightly better for the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere, but they are much better than the Orionids. “They are also at their best around 2am-3am local time but depending on where you are in the country, you can start seeing them a bit earlier in the evening.” He says those who watch the Geminids event could see between 30 and 60 meteors an hour.",

    "title": "Albanese arrives in US for Trump meeting as Republican congressman says Aukus  keeps Xi up at night  | Australian foreign policy",
    "text": "Anthony Albanese has arrived in the US for a long-awaited meeting with President Donald Trump, where they are expected to discuss the Aukus pact – an agreement a respected Republican has called a “crucial deterrent” in the Indo-Pacific that “keeps [the Chinese president, Xi Jinping] up at night”. Albanese arrived in Washington DC late on Sunday night local time (Monday afternoon AEDT) ahead of his meeting with Trump at the White House on Monday morning local time (Tuesday morning AEDT). The two men will meet in the Oval Office, followed by a scheduled lunch afterward, according to the White House. Disembarking his jet into heavy rain in Maryland, Albanese was greeted on the tarmac by Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, and other diplomatic officials. Albanese said it was “wonderful to be here”, stepping off the plane after nearly 24 hours in transit on to a waiting motorcade that ferried him into Washington DC. Albanese and Trump were expected to discuss Aukus and defence, trade and tariffs among other economic issues, and the potential for Australia to furnish the US with a guaranteed supply of critical minerals. The Pentagon review of Aukus – which was signed by Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden – remained ongoing, a Department of War spokesperson told Guardian Australia last week. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas who until recently chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he hoped plans for a “strong and successful” Aukus would be high on Trump and Albanese’s meeting agenda, even as a Pentagon review into the partnership remained ongoing. McCaul, who also formerly served as chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, spoke highly of Aukus on the eve of Albanese’s visit. “While serving as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I worked extensively to reform and strengthen AUKUS, which I believe serves as a critical deterrent to the CCP’s malign activities in the Indo-Pacific,” McCaul told Guardian Australia. “As I’ve been told in my briefings, AUKUS is what keeps Chairman Xi up at night.” Labor government sources were confident the ongoing Pentagon review of Aukus would rubber-stamp the agreement, which would permit Australia to buy between three and five American-made nuclear-powered submarines in the 2030s. Later, locally made SSN-Aukus submarines were projected to begin coming into service in the 2040s. Albanese said in a written statement before he departed he was looking forward “to a positive and constructive meeting”, and he hoped to “consolidate and strengthen the Australia-United States relationship”. Despite government confidence that Trump’s government would stay true to the original Aukus plan, there were fears Trump could seek to extract a better deal for America or make changes to the timeline. McCaul said he was encouraged by Albanese’s meeting with Trump, and hoped the face-to-face would “include a discussion on how to make AUKUS strong and successful for years to come”. Ahead of Albanese’s visit, Labor sources noted the government’s showering of money on American shipyards, and an enthusiasm among congressional leaders that the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, described as “evangelical” on Friday. Australia has already contributed US$1bn to support American manufacturing, with another $1bn due by the end of the year. While it is possible that Albanese could confirm the next instalment of that payment during his visit with Trump, Australian sources downplayed prospects of the Pentagon review being released during the Washington trip. Trump has given no explicit endorsement or guarantee of Aukus since coming to office. When asked about Aukus in February, Trump responded: “What does that mean?” Concerns over the pace and efficiency of current US shipbuilding have raised worries over whether Australia will be able to purchase the Virginia-class submarines as scheduled. The US Navy estimates it needs to be building Virginia-class submarines at a rate of about 2.33 a year to have enough boats to sell any to Australia, but as of July was building them at a rate of about 1.13 a year. The former Australian Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull told the ABC he believed there was “no way” Trump would back away from Aukus, because it was “a fantastic deal for the Americans, a terrible deal for Australia”. He cited the multibillion-dollar Australian investment into American shipbuilding, and billions spent on the new defence precinct at Henderson, which could be used by US military. Turnbull – who had his own famous argument with Trump in 2017 – said Albanese should be “upfront, strong, and should not suck up” to the president during the meeting.",

    "title": "Country diary : The salty symphony of waders in autumn | Birds",
    "text": "When I say the wader roost on the Wash at this RSPB reserve is one of the greatest sights in British nature, it understates one of its central elements: the everyday ordinariness of it. After all, it unfolds once every 12 hours throughout autumn and winter. Go for half a day and you couldn’t fail to have an encounter. Each visit is also different. Some friends have been to photograph it on hundreds of occasions, and still they return. It can occasionally be quite flat – the birds, perhaps 250,000 of them, follow the tide’s incoming and outgoing, but only slowly, sub‑flock by sub-flock; no alarm, no drama or sudden movement, and little adrenaline. Usually, however, it is unforgettable. This time it wasn’t the sight of all those fellow creatures that moved me. Rather, it was their sounds I tracked, and I could have closed my eyes and been just as affected. I should add further that on this visit there was none of what I’d seen two days previously: then it was mainly knots and godwits, from the northernmost rim of our planet, twisting and converging like a balled fist as peregrine and merlin made forays at the tide edge. Instead, there were thousands of knots inland from where we stood, and they came over us as they went back to the freshly exposed mud. The movements were episodic, a few thousand at a time, one to two metres above head height. Knots have long, pointed wings; their flight action is intense, high-paced, direct; and those pipe-like formations assailed us with that thrumming music of wind through tightly hauled canvas. Blended with it were the sounds of oystercatchers, a metal-on-stone clanging as they flew away in pied chains back to the Wash; then the curlew calls, bell-clear and looping in shape, rose above percussive piping from a whimbrel flock, all against the muted whickering of godwits further off. There were also some dry, squirted notes from skylarks overhead. At one moment, in a lull among this salty Stravinsky-esque birdstorm, there was a solitary linnet, whose high, liquid notes were isolated in pitch and place, and which seemed to bathe us for just a second in unexpected sweetness.",

    "title": "  It madnes : bat enthusiasts fear planning bill will derail years of conservation | Conservation",
    "text": "“There are the most extraordinary things we could learn from them,” says Brian Briggs, as he checks yet another of the bat boxes that he and his wife, Patty, have put up just outside Heathrow. “They’re completely fascinating, from all kinds of angles.” It’s a damp Sunday morning at Bedfont Lakes country park, and the Nathusius’ research project team, led by Patty, is checking the artificial roosters, looking at the health and number of different bat species. This outing, however, is a little different from normal; the conversation is focused not on the bats but on the government’s planning and infrastructure bill, which the following day will be having its final reading in the House of Lords. The group believes the bill will undo decades of progress in the conservation of protected species. “They’re going to derail all the good conservation work that this country has been notable for,” says Patty, while noting down the bats she has found in the roosting boxes. “We need to look after what’s left.” Patty is a conservationist, now in her 70s, who first became interested in bats in 1985, not long after bats were first protected in this country. “I started doing a lot of research into barn conversions and bats in barns. I remember going into one barn conversion and they were putting a new bathroom wall up. They discovered a bat and had the presence of mind to call someone, and I went there at dusk and discovered a colony of 30 natterer’s bats. If the builder carried on, he would’ve walled them in without knowing.” Somehow, for the Briggs, bats became part of their life. “When Patty became interested in it, people began bringing injured bats to us,” says Brian, 80. “In my previous existence I had been an anaesthetist. The way people tried to anaesthetise bats in those days was to just put them in the fridge and allow them to go torpid. Which was not kind. So with a local vet and a local wildlife hospital we worked out a way to safely anaesthetise them.” They would, when possible, get the bats back to health and then release them again. Checking along the bat boxes, just five in 37 are occupied: Patty says this is fewer bats than they normally see, and notes the absence of their usual nathusius’ pipistrelles. “The bat boxes are often used as male mating sites,” says Patty. “A male bat will adopt a bat box as his, and anoint the entrance with his scent, then at night he will sing ultrasonically for all the girls who will join him for a party in his box. “They aren’t disturbed by the planes. They live in an ultrasonic world.” The planning bill that she and Brian are so anxious about has been designed by the Labour government to speed up housebuilding; the government says these “pro-growth changes” will accelerate its “plan for change”. But concerns have grown throughout the process. Nature groups fear the bill will allow developers to plough through some of our most precious nature. In June, the Guardian highlighted 5,000 sites that could be at risk under the controversial bill, and in the last week several last-minute amendments have heightened anxieties. “It’s madness,” says Brian. “How can you possibly tell if there are bats without going and having a look?” Under the new law, developers would be able to build on protected sites and instead put money into a nature restoration fund, which would be used at a later date to create environmental improvements elsewhere. “It’s a pay-to-destroy system,” says Patty. “Developers will put money into a fund to pay for compensation, but it may be nowhere near an important colony which needs help.” “If a colony loses the ability to meet up – maybe their wood has been cut down for a building scheme – the colony is fragmented into two groups. Then that small group is not able to generate the heat they need for the babies to grow and develop.”",

    "title": "A - level English , voluntary work , delayed citizenship : it Labour Orwellian Two Minutes Hate for immigrants | Nesrine Malik",
    "text": "Every few weeks, another announcement. Immigrants must do this to earn the right to stay in the UK. Others must do that if they are to be allowed to work in the UK. The demands grow more punitive and absurd, like the whiteboard of a meeting where everyone agreed there were no bad ideas. Voluntary work! A decade to receive citizenship! Hear me out: English A-levels! These are all real policies and pledges. Migrant NHS doctors for example, labouring for long work days beyond what they are paid for will now have to prove that they “contribute to society” to earn permanent settlement in the UK. The benchmark for that contribution is volunteer work (sorry, more volunteer work) in the community. The five-year route to settlement is now being extended to 10, to make absolutely sure that in addition to being in work, paying taxes, making national insurance contributions and paying a hefty charge to use the NHS, you’re not taking the piss. The latest demand is that some migrants must be able to speak English to A-level standard because, according to home secretary Shabana Mahmood, “it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life”. I should pause here to explain the English requirements that are already in place, and who this concerns. The migrants this policy applies to are in the “skilled worker”, “high-potential individual” and “scale up” categories, which allow companies to recruit talented individuals for skilled roles. There is already a test which proves that these individuals can broadly get by – it’s called a job interview. Besides, the visas associated with these categories already require people to be able to speak English to GCSE level. Is it now important that applicants must be able to analyse the form of an extract from The Woman in Black? I’m not quite sure. I do not have an English A-level, like the vast majority of people in the UK, who somehow have not crashed the economy for lack of that qualification. You see, A-level English capability is obviously not a serious or carefully considered benchmark, but an opportunity to say some strong stuff about “coming here and not speaking our language”. Like so many political interventions, this one is based on elision, on invoking a lumpen grunting blob of immigrants who can’t and won’t speak English, won’t “play their part” and must be constantly subject to new crackdowns to prove their worth and their assimilation. There is an entire industry surrounding the UK’s existing residency and citizenship requirements, from tests about Boudicca and Elizabethan poets to English-language tests where you must converse at a high level with an examiner, as well as other written and spoken exams that feed into UK embassies and visa processing centres across the world. But we have now entered the territory of unreality, where there are ever-more announcements whose sole purpose is to give a sense that a crisis is being handled. The supposedly unifying thread of all these new policies is “integration”: this mythical concept that has taken on the quality of a religious ideal. But let’s talk about all the ways integration happens, and whether, in fact, it is even something that is on offer for all, not just migrants. Integration is based on facilitating interaction and enmeshment in a society. It depends upon the children’s centre that links parents to others in the community and pools advice and resources. It depends on the libraries that provide literature and history and local knowledge. It depends on youth clubs and midwife visits and community centres and public-sector workers who are not so burnt out at the end of a day working in under-resourced schools and hospitals that they have no bandwidth to volunteer their work in their communities. Yet all of these services have been hollowed out by years of austerity, pushing people back into their own small networks and atomised lives. How integrated do you feel on a regular basis? Do you have an extended society of neighbours and drop-in centres and free spaces that haven’t been sold off for development where you can spend time with other people? I doubt it. Britain really is that island of strangers, yet the sense of social alienation that is now a quintessentially contemporary British experience has been forged by economic and political decisions, not immigrants. At the same time, we have started building our own bubbles, exacerbating this sense of isolation. We don’t all consume the same media any more, and mobile phones and livestreaming have allowed for the creation of infinite personalised silos of existence. Modernity and austerity combine to fracture collective experience but, well, who would want to reckon with these histories? What political establishment has any interest in the hard work of tackling what can be done to address that fraying of the national fabric, when you can erect some ideal of an integrated society that does not exist, and lay its arbitrary expectations on immigrants who must now alone prop up the delusion that the problem isn’t in the place they are coming to, but in them. The role that has been assigned to them is symptomatic of an impoverished conception of national identity and patriotism. One that is increasingly brought to us in displays of loyalty to the flag, and not much else. In place of true social integration, we have fascist-coded notions of national identity imposed from above, while what lies below remains fractured and ravaged, creating fertile ground for the far right. But do not fret. Hear me out. What if we had a cricket Test match: two teams of migrants, over an entertaining five days, proving that they can make a contribution to our national life. Whoever wins gets citizenship. With this, Nigel Farage will be finished. - Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

    "title": "Bolivia election : Centrist Rodrigo Paz wins presidency , ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule",
    "text": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff on Sunday, defeating conservative rival Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, as the country’s worst economic crisis in a generation helped propel the end of nearly two decades of leftist rule. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote, beating Quiroga’s 45.5%, according to early results from Bolivia’s electoral tribunal. But Paz’s party does not hold a majority in the country’s legislature, which will force him to forge alliances to govern effectively. The new president takes office on November 8. The 58-year-old senator’s win marks a historic shift for the South American country, governed almost continuously since 2006 by Bolivia’s Movement to Socialism, or MAS, which once enjoyed overwhelming support from the country’s Indigenous majority. Paz’s moderate platform — pledging to maintain social programs while promoting private sector-led growth — appeared to resonate with left-leaning voters disillusioned by the ruling MAS, founded by former President Evo Morales, but wary of Quiroga’s proposed austerity measures. Support for MAS cratered in the August first round amid a deepening economic crisis. “This election marks a political turning point,” said Glaeldys Gonzalez Calanche, analyst for the Southern Andes at International Crisis Group. “Bolivia is heading in a new direction,” she said. Both runoff candidates pledged to strengthen diplomatic ties with Washington — strained since 2009 — and seek US-backed financial support to stabilize Bolivia’s fragile economy. In late September, Paz unveiled plans for a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal with US officials to ensure fuel supplies. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that both presidential candidates “want stronger, better relations with the United States,” after decades of anti-American leadership. “This election is a transformative opportunity,” he said on October 15. Outside a polling station in La Paz, Lourdes Mendoza said she had grown weary of the MAS era. “My children were born and raised with a single government,” she said. “I hope they can see other possibilities and alternatives.” Voters want economic change Bolivia’s fragile economy dominated the runoff campaign. Once plentiful natural gas exports have plummeted, inflation is at a 40-year high, and fuel is scarce. Both candidates campaigned to roll back elements of the MAS era, state-led model, but differed over how drastically. Paz favored gradual reform, including tax incentives for small businesses and regional fiscal autonomy, while Quiroga proposed sweeping cuts and an IMF bailout. “We’re going for a new stage of Bolivian democracy in the 21st century,” Paz told Reuters two days before the election at his family’s ranch in the southern gas-producing region of Tarija. “We’re going to try to build an economy for the people,” he said, one where “the state is no longer going to be the central axis.” Some voters said they were not convinced that his victory represented a true break from MAS: “I think he’s a puppet of the outgoing government,” said 21-year-old Esther Miranda from La Paz, who works in a nail salon. Running mate’s populist appeal boosts Paz Paz’s campaign was boosted by his running mate Edman Lara, a former police officer known for viral TikTok videos exposing corruption. Lara’s populist appeal helped Paz connect with younger and working-class voters, analysts said. Economists warn the incoming administration faces immediate challenges, including securing fuel supplies and building coalitions in a fragmented legislature. Outgoing hydrocarbons minister Alejandro Gallardo said last week that the state energy company was struggling to obtain foreign currency for fuel imports. Paz told Reuters he was already addressing the issue through deferred payment agreements with fuel suppliers to ensure diesel and gasoline arrive within days of his inauguration. Paz said he would also begin phasing out universal fuel subsidies. Targeted support would go to vulnerable groups, while bigger industries such as agribusiness would pay market rates for fuel. “The market will have to adjust prices, but there are sectors that will have government support until the economy is reactivated,” he said. Bolivia’s main labor union, the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), has previously warned it would oppose any threats to the social and economic gains achieved so far, in a sign of the juggling act for Paz’s government to avoid street protests. Paz’s PDC won 49 of 130 seats in the lower house and 16 of 36 in the Senate, just ahead of Quiroga’s coalition, which secured 43 seats in the lower house and 12 in the Senate.",

    "text": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz wins Bolivia's presidential runoff, topping right-wing rival LA PAZ, Bolivia — Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator who was never a nationally prominent figure until now, won Bolivia's presidential election on Sunday, preliminary results showed, galvanizing voters outraged by the country's economic crisis and frustrated after 20 years of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism party. \"The trend is irreversible,\" Óscar Hassenteufel, the president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, said of Paz's lead over his rival, former right-wing President Jorge \"Tuto\" Quiroga. Paz won 54% of the votes, early results showed, versus Quiroga's 45%. Paz took the podium Sunday night flanked by his wife, María Helena Urquidi, and four adult children. The hotel ballroom in Bolivia's capital of La Paz went wild, with people shouting his name and holding phones aloft. \"Today, Bolivia can be certain that this will be a government that will bring solutions,\" he told supporters. \"Bolivia breathes winds of change and renewal to move forward.\" Shortly after the results came in, Quiroga conceded to Paz. \"I've called Rodrigo Paz and wished him congratulations,\" he said in a somber speech, prompting jeers and cries of fraud from the audience. But Quiroga urged calm, saying that a refusal to recognize the results would \"leave the country hanging.\" \"We'd just exacerbate the problems of people suffering from the crisis,\" he said. \"We need a mature attitude right now.\" Paz and his popular running mate, ex-police Capt. Edman Lara, gained traction among working-class and rural voters disillusioned with the unbridled spending of the long-ruling Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party but wary of Quiroga's radical 180-degree turn away from its social protections. Quiroga's embrace of the International Monetary Fund — an organization that has long aroused political resentment in Bolivia — for a shock treatment package of the kind Bolivians came to know and fear in the 1990s also alienated more moderate voters. Paz's victory sets this South American nation of 12 million on a sharply uncertain path as he seeks to enact major change for the first time since the 2005 election of Evo Morales, the founder of MAS and Bolivia's first Indigenous president. Although Paz's Christian Democratic Party has the cushion of a slight majority in Congress, he'll still need to compromise to push through an ambitious overhaul. Paz plans to end Bolivia's fixed exchange rate, phase out generous fuel subsidies and reduce hefty public investment, redrawing much of the MAS economic model that dominated for two decades. But he says he'll maintain MAS-style benefits and take a gradual approach to free-market reforms, in hopes of avoiding a sharp recession or jump in inflation that would enrage the masses — as has happened before in Bolivia. Morales' effort to lift fuel subsidies in 2011 lasted less than a week as protests engulfed the country. Paz inherits an economy in shambles Paz's supporters erupted into raucous cheers and ran into the streets of La Paz, setting off fireworks and honking car horns. Crowds thronged a hotel downtown where Paz spoke, some shouting, \"The people, united, will never be defeated!\" \"We feel victorious,\" Roger Carrillo, a volunteer with Paz's party, said by phone from eastern Bolivia, where he was rallying a celebratory caravan. \"We know there is work ahead of us but we just want to enjoy this moment.\" Behind the celebrations, Bolivia faces an uphill battle. Since 2023, the Andean nation has been crippled by a shortage of U.S. dollars that has locked Bolivians out of their own savings and hampered imports. Year-on-year inflation soared to 23% last month, the highest rate since 1991. Fuel shortages paralyze the country, with motorists often waiting days in line to fill up their tanks. To make it through even his first months, Paz must replenish the country's meager foreign currency reserves and get fuel imports flowing. Vowing to avoid the IMF, Paz has pledged to scrape together the necessary cash by fighting corruption, reducing wasteful spending and restoring enough confidence in the country's currency to lure U.S. dollar savings out from under Bolivians' mattresses and into the banking system. But Paz's stated reluctance to slam on the fiscal brakes — with promises of cash handouts for the poor to cushion the blow of subsidy cuts — has led to criticism. \"It's just so vague, I feel like he's saying these things to please voters when fiscally it doesn't add up,\" said 48-year-old Rodrigo Tribeño, who voted for Quiroga on Sunday. \"We needed a real change.\" An outsider with political experience Although Paz, the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who was in office from 1989 to 1993, has spent more than two decades in politics as a lawmaker and mayor, he appeared in this race as a political unknown. The senator rose unexpectedly from the bottom of the polls to a first-place finish in the August vote. His party swept six of nine regional departments in the country, including the Andean highlands of western Bolivia and the large, coca-producing region of Cochabamba, winning over key swaths of Indigenous Aymara and working-class Bolivians that once comprised Morales' base. Paz's slogan of \"capitalism for all\" appealed to many merchants and entrepreneurs who flourished in Morales' heyday but later chafed against his high taxes and regulation. Quiroga, by contrast, carried the wealthier eastern lowlands of Santa Cruz, known as the country's agricultural engine. \"There's a very clear class difference. For Quiroga, you have people who've been in politics and in the economic elite for a long time — businesspeople, agro-industrialists,\" said Verónica Rocha, a Bolivian political analyst. \"With Paz, it's the opposite.\" An ex-cop shakes up the race The race looked to be a staid affair until Paz surprised everyone by picking Lara as his running mate. The charismatic young ex-policeman had zero political experience but gained fame on TikTok after being fired from the police for denouncing corruption in viral videos. Out of work, he sold second-hand clothes to get by and worked as a lawyer helping Bolivians come forward about corruption — a story that resonated with many former MAS supporters. Lara's fiery, populist promises of universal income for women and higher pensions for retirees frequently forced Paz into damage control, causing tension on the campaign trail. But for those who see Lara as divisive and hot-headed, there are plenty of Bolivians who say those traits connote authenticity in comparison to the other scripted, telegenic candidates. Lara struck an unusually conciliatory tone in his remarks after winning Sunday. \"It's time to unite, it's time to reconcile,\" Lara told supporters after learning of his win, taking a more conciliatory tone than usual. \"Political divisions are over.\" Many Bolivians interviewed Sunday said they voted for Lara as if he were at the top of the ticket. \"Lara is the one acting more like a president than Paz. Many of us think Lara will end up running the country,\" said Wendy Cornejo, 28, a former Morales supporter selling crackers in downtown La Paz.",

    "text": "Man who appeared to fake his death and flee to the UK faces sentencing for Utah rape A U.S. man who authorities say faked his death and fled to the United Kingdom to avoid rape charges is scheduled to be sentenced in Utah on Monday SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Rhode Island man who appeared to fake his death and flee the United States to avoid rape charges is scheduled to be sentenced Monday on one of two rape convictions in Utah. Nicholas Rossi, 38, faces between five years and life in prison when sentenced Monday by District Judge Barry Lawrence in Salt Lake City. The sentence is the first of two scheduled for Rossi after he was convicted separately in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 4 for the second conviction, also for five years to life in prison. In August, jurors found Rossi guilty of rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand. Rossi did not testify on his own behalf. It took more than a decade from the time of the rapes to his convictions. Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit tied to the other case. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog. Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead. He was arrested in Scotland the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19. Hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos — including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended — from an Interpol notice. He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture. In his first Utah trial, Rossi's public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas. The victim had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks. She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn’t be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said. She went to police years later after hearing Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time. The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer. Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he also faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008. ___ Gruver reported from Ft. Collins, Colorado.",

    "text": "Philadelphia police find human remains in search for missing woman Philadelphia police have found human remains near where investigators were searching for a 23-year-old woman who disappeared from her nursing home job about two weeks ago PHILADELPHIA -- PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia police found human remains Saturday in their search for a 23-year-old woman who disappeared from her nursing home job about two weeks ago. Police held a news conference Saturday to give an update on the disappearance of Kada Scott and released a statement saying investigators “recovered human remains believed to be\" hers. But John Stanford, deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, stopped short of confirming the remains found in a wooded area behind an abandoned school were Scott's. An anonymous tip led police to the area they'd previously searched, according to Stanford. He said the remains, believed to be the body of a woman, were found in a shallow grave. He added that it appeared the person had been dead for several days. “We are not going to confirm, at this point, that it is Kada Scott because that has to be done by the medical examiner’s office,” he said. “There’s still a lot of work to be done.” Stanford said investigators were in touch with Scott's family on the developments but he declined to answer specific questions, citing an active investigation. Police spokeswoman Tanya Little said Sunday that the department did not have any updates. A message left Sunday for the medical examiner’s office wasn’t immediately returned. The case has prompted questions about the justice system. Twenty-one-year-old Keon King has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking and other charges in the disappearance of Scott. He had been allowed to go free after being charged in a similar case earlier this year. In the Scott case, King’s bail has been set at $2.5 million. He remains in custody and has a preliminary hearing next month. His defense attorney did not return a message seeking comment.",

    "text": "Thousands of Orthodox Jews rally in New York to protest change in Israel's military draft rules Protesters have marched near the Israeli consulate in New York City over issues including the drafting of ultra-Orthodox Jews into Israel’s military NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews packed the streets and sidewalks for blocks around the Israeli consulate in New York City on Sunday to protest issues including a potential end of an exemption for religious students from compulsory service in Israel's military. The protest at the consulate, a block from the United Nations campus in Manhattan, illustrated the complex relationship between Israel and segments of the large population of very religious Jews in New York and its suburbs. The two influential, and often rival, grand rebbes of the Satmar community both called on adherents to participate in the demonstration. The Central Rabbinical Congress of the U.S.A. and Canada, a consortium of Orthodox Jewish groups, said it helped organize the protest. It comes after Israel's Supreme Court last year ordered the government to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish men into the military. There had been a longstanding enlistment exemption — dating to the founding of Israel in 1948. The ultra-Orthodox worry that mandatory enlistment will impact adherents’ ties to their faith. But many Jewish Israelis have argued that an exemption is unfair. Rifts over the issue have deepened since the start of the war in Gaza. Rabbi Moishe Indig, a Satmar community leader, said he's not sure organizers expected so many people to show up but he said he felt urgency building around the issue. He said he was appreciative of the governments in New York and the U.S. “for giving us the freedom and liberty to be able to live free and have our children go to school and study and learn the Torah.\"",

    "text": "Trump administration to defend Alina Habba's tenure as top New Jersey prosecutor A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments over whether President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey since earlier this year PHILADELPHIA -- PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments Monday over whether President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey since earlier this year. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled a hearing in Philadelphia over Habba's appointment, which a lower court judge said in August was done with a “novel series of legal and personnel moves” and that she was not lawfully serving as U.S attorney for New Jersey. The judge's order said that her actions since July could be declared void but put his order on hold so the U.S. Justice Department could appeal. Habba is validly serving in the role under a federal statute that permits the first assistant attorney, a post she was appointed to by the Trump administration, the government said in court briefs ahead of Monday's hearing. A similar dynamic is playing out in Nevada, where a federal judge disqualified the administration's pick to be U.S. attorney there. In the Habba case, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann's decision came after several people charged with federal crimes in New Jersey challenged the legality of Habba’s tenure. They sought to block the charges, arguing she didn’t have the authority to prosecute their cases after her 120-day term as interim U.S. attorney expired. Habba was Trump's attorney in criminal and civil proceedings before he was elected to a second term. She served as a White House adviser briefly before Trump named her as a federal prosecutor in March. Shortly after her appointment, she said in an interview she hoped to help “turn New Jersey red,” a rare overt political expression from a prosecutor, and said she planned to investigate the state’s Democratic governor and attorney general. She then brought a trespassing charge, eventually dropped, against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka stemming from his visit to a federal immigration detention center. Habba later charged Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assault stemming from the same incident, a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress other than for corruption. McIver denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. The case is pending. Questions about whether Habba would continue in the job arose in July when her temporary appointment was ending and it became clear New Jersey’s two Democratic U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, would not back her appointment. With her appointment expiring, federal judges in New Jersey exercised their power under the law to replace Habba with a career prosecutor who had served as her second in-command. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi then fired the prosecutor installed by the judges and renamed Habba as acting U.S. attorney. The Justice Department said the judges acted prematurely and said Trump had the authority to appoint his preferred candidate to enforce federal laws in the state. Brann’s ruling said the president’s appointments are still subject to the time limits and power-sharing rules laid out in federal law.",

    "text": "China accuses US of cyberattack on national time center China has accused the U.S. National Security Agency of cyberattacks on its national time center BEIJING -- BEIJING (AP) — China on Sunday accused the U.S. National Security Agency of carrying out cyberattacks on its national time center, saying any damage to related facilities could have disrupted network communications, financial systems and power supply. The Ministry of State Security alleged that the U.S. agency had exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information from devices of the National Time Service Center's staff in 2022. It did not specify the brand. The U.S. agency also used 42 types of “special cyberattack weapons” to target the center's multiple internal network systems and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024, it said in a post on WeChat, a Chinese social media platform. The ministry said it had evidence but did not provide it in the post. It said the time center is responsible for generating and distributing China’s standard time, in addition to providing timing services to industries such as communications, finance, power, transport and defense. The ministry added that it had provided guidance to the center to eliminate the risks. “The U.S. is accusing others of what it does itself, repeatedly hyping up claims about Chinese cyber threats,” the post said. Western governments in recent years have alleged hackers linked to the Chinese government have targeted officials, journalists, corporations and others. The ministry's statement could fuel tensions between Washington and Beijing, on top of trade, technology and Taiwan issues. The U.S. Embassy did not address the Chinese allegation in an emailed response. The response focused on China's cyberattacks, calling them the most active and persistent threat to the U.S. government and companies.",
