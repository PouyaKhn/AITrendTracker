    "text": "Rangers 'didn't screw up' head coach appointment - Published Chairman Andrew Cavenagh insists Rangers did not \"screw up\" the process to appoint head coach Danny Rohl but admits it looked \"clunky\" from the outside. The Ibrox club came close to appointing both Steven Gerrard and Kevin Muscat before agreeing a deal with Rohl, who himself withdrew from the process before eventually taking the role. Both sporting director Kevin Thelwell and chief executive Patrick Stewart have been criticised by Rangers supporters for their perceived roles in the club's poor start to the campaign, but Cavenagh defended their work in finding Russell Martin's successor. \"I think the misconception that's out there that I'd like to just clarify around the names you mentioned is that somehow [Thelwell and Stewart] screwed it up,\" Cavenagh said. \"I was involved in every single telephone call, every single meeting, every minute with both [Gerrard and Muscat]. \"And I don't believe that they didn't come because they didn't like Patrick or they didn't want a sporting director. \"Eventually, it didn't work largely due to timing on their part, a little bit on our part with the case of Kevin. - Published15 hours ago - Published18 hours ago \"But, while that was going on, we had obviously reengaged behind the scenes unbeknownst to people with Danny. \"While I'm happy to talk about this, our focus going forward is not on who didn't come, it's on who did come and we're incredibly happy that Danny Rohl is the head coach of Rangers Football Club.\" Cavenagh says some reporting of the managerial hunt was not entirely factual, which led to the perception that the process did not run smoothly. \"There's asymmetric information - what's out in the press versus what is actually happening,\" he said. \"It looked clunky from the outside perspective. It wasn't at all clunky from our perspective inside the club.\" Why didn't a deal happen for Gerrard or Muscat? Cavenagh insists Rangers never had a leading candidate and dismissed the idea that Rohl was third choice behind Gerrard and Muscat. Talks were held with several coaches in London beyond Rohl, Muscat and Gerrard and Cavenagh says there were five names he would have been delighted to move forward with. \"We interviewed a number of great candidates,\" he said. \"We spoke to a number of other candidates that you've never heard about. \"We left London 10 days ago, having done a whole bunch of meetings and I said to our group how happy I was that we had five candidates - not the three that have been talked about - I was extremely comfortable would be great coaches for Rangers.\" When pressed on why Rangers were unable to finalise a deal for either Gerrard or Muscat, Cavenagh described both situations as \"complicated\". \"We didn't rank people one, two and three,\" he said. \"We had 10 days at that point, tops, to get a coach into the building, so we pursued all five simultaneously. \"Was anybody offered the job? The way that it works isn't like that. You don't have a big ceremony and send somebody a letter with a bow on it.\" The American implied that neither Gerrard nor Muscat were officially offered the role as they pursued multiple candidates simultaneously. \"You're working on a whole bunch of different details at the same time,\" he added. \"The two people you mention are complicated. \"They're halfway around the world, they have families, they'd have to move, they're coming in mid-season. \"So what you're trying to do on every candidate is just constantly try to move the ball forward and figure out, 'can we make this happen'? And again, we're doing that with five different people at once.\" Related topics - Published18 June 2023",

    "title": "CNN Call to Earth Day celebrates fifth anniversary",
    "text": "CNN’s Call to Earth Day celebrates fifth anniversary On November 6th, 2025, CNN will mark the fifth edition of its global Call to Earth Day initiative, celebrating how people and cultures come together to protect the planet. Partnering with schools, individuals, and organisations across the world, CNN will use its global multiplatform presence for a day of action to raise awareness of environmental issues and to engage with conservation education. The theme for 2025 is Guard Your Green Space, urging individuals, communities, and nations to take bold, collective action to protect their part of the natural world that sustains us. From rewilding initiatives in Europe, to tree-planting campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa, to filling a school garden with native plants in the United States, people around the world are showing that protecting green spaces is both possible and powerful. Call to Earth Day will see CNN use its international scope to celebrate this spirit and showcase efforts – large or small – that are already underway and making a difference. Last year’s Call to Earth Day saw over 230,000 people participating in more than 660 events, across five continents and 107 countries. Registrations for 2025 have already exceeded those of last year, marking a record number of participants for Call to Earth Day. Call to Earth Day will spotlight the individuals devoting their lives to safeguarding the different corners of our natural world. On the day, stories, live programming, interviews, and a mix of long and short form content gathered from across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and both North and South America, will run in every hour of CNN International programming. This will include interviews across CNN International and CNN en Español with Rolex Awards Laureates Emma Camp, Rodrigo Medellin, and Maritza Morales Casanova. Stories will air in CNN’s news and sports programming, with a report highlighting the Sail GP Impact League, a unique initiative that combines sustainability with the competition of sport, appearing in CNN’s World Sport. CNN Creators: The Intro will also air a special show dedicated to Call to Earth Day. As part of the celebrations, CNN’s Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir will sit down with leading oceanographer, explorer and Rolex Testimonee, Sylvia Earle, who celebrated her 90th birthday in August. The world-renowned marine biologist joins Weir at her DOER Marine facility in Alameda, California to talk about the future of conservation, lessons she can pass on from her own experience, and how our oceans need our help now more than ever. The interview will air as a half-hour documentary ‘No Blue, No Green: A Conversation with Sylvia Earle’, honouring her as one of the pioneers who laid the foundation for modern conservation and understanding how the new generation can carry their mission forward. CNN en Español will air Llamado a la Tierra elements throughout every live show on November 6th. This will include packages from Colombia, Panama, Mexico, Costa Rica, and a special half-hour, hosted by Elizabeth Perez, featuring Rolex Awards Laureate Kerstin Forsberg, founder and director of the non-profit Planeta Océano. Content will additionally be available on CNN Arabic, while CNN’s daily ten-minute student-focused news show, CNN10, will air a theme week in the lead up to Call to Earth Day. Bespoke digital content will also run across CNN.com, including an interactive feature examining the impact of invasive fire ant species, and a live blog on the day that will highlight contributions from around the world. CNN’s multiplatform content will be complemented by a series of live events, with participants encouraged to share their actions, ideas, and inspirational thoughts using the hashtag #CallToEarth. CNN has also worked with climate influencers on custom videos that will roll out across the CNN Climate social handles in the run up to November 6th. Speaking about the anniversary, CNN Group Senior Vice President, GM APAC, and Global Head of Productions, Ellana Lee said, “This fifth anniversary is a chance to reflect on the successes of Call to Earth Day, as well as look ahead to the future. Each year, we’ve seen more schools and organisations come together to celebrate a planet worth protecting, and this year is no exception with over 500,000 participants around the world expected to take action. At CNN, we are proud to continue to provide a platform that amplifies these efforts and inspires action for future generations. The growth and impact of Call to Earth Day over the past five years is a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when we work together.” Call to Earth Day is part of Call to Earth, a major network initiative launched by CNN in 2019, in partnership with Rolex and its Perpetual Planet Initiative, shining a light on those committed to safeguarding our planet for future generations. Over the last six years, this award-winning programming has told stories of changemakers, visionaries, and ground-breaking projects making a difference to the world around them.
