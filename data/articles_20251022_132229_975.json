    "text": "'My autistic son deserved better from Waitrose' The mother of an autistic man who was told he had to stop stacking shelves at a Waitrose store where he had worked as a volunteer for years has said he \"deserved better\". Frances Boyd said her son Tom, 28, began work experience at the Cheadle Hulme store in Greater Manchester in 2021, and continued to work unpaid, accompanied by a support worker, as it gave him \"a sense of purpose and belonging\". However, she said when she asked if he could be offered \"just a few paid hours\" in July, the supermarket chain's head office told him he had to stop and could not return to the store. A spokesman said Waitrose \"worked hard to be an inclusive employer\" and was investigating the matter \"as a priority\". Ms Boyd said Tom, who has limited communication skills, started at the store as part of his skills development for the workplace on his further education course, and continued to volunteer on two mornings a week. She said he was \"so proud of his work\", which involved putting stock out and tidying the shelves, and was praised for his work ethic by managers. \"If I went in and saw him, he was smiling, and it gave him independence, a sense of purpose and belonging. \"He gave over 600 hours of his time purely because he wanted to belong, contribute, and make a difference. \"We feel deeply let down.\" A Waitrose & Partners spokesman said it worked with a number of charities to provide work experience and was \"well experienced in making reasonable adjustments to help people succeed at work\". \"We are sorry to hear of Tom's story and whilst we cannot comment on individual cases, we are investigating as a priority,\" he said. Ms Boyd said his placement was stopped when the firm's head office was asked about the possibility of paid work. She said she was told it was because he \"couldn't perform the whole role\". \"He deserved better,\" she added. \"He deserved kindness, respect and the chance for all his hard work to mean something. \"No-one should be made to feel their contribution doesn't matter, especially someone who's given so much of themselves for so long.\" Volunteers do not have the same rights as an employee or worker, according to the government, though there are expectations for those undertaking vocational training. The guidance states that those who volunteer should usually get a volunteer agreement that sets out the level of supervision and support they will receive. It should also include advice on training and whether they were covered by the organisation's insurance, as well as information about expenses and health and safety issues. However, the agreements are not compulsory and do not form a contract. Ms Boyd said she wanted to see legal protections like those afforded to employees by the Equality Act to extend to volunteers to ensure they have \"rights and opportunities\". \"They can be terminated at any time and that's not really the way we should be moving forward in society today,\" she added.

    "title": "Relief over inflation so what now for the Budget ? ",
    "text": "Relief over inflation, but what now for the Budget? There's relief for many today that inflation didn't hit the feared 4% last month - relief for households, the government and the Bank of England. But at 3.8% in the year to September, inflation remains considerably above the Bank's target and while that persists, consumers may remain jittery about spending, uneasy about the future path of prices. After all, during the spike in inflation a couple of years back, they experienced the equivalent of more than a typical decade's worth of price rises in just two years. They, and their finances, are scarred. And inflation in some areas such as services - think hotels and restaurants - remains stubborn. Sectors such as hospitality are most likely to have seen their wage bills rise substantially - analysts suggest by as much as 10% - due to government policies such as higher minimum wages and tax increases over the past year. But there are signs that things are settling down - food prices eased for the first time in months in September, as the impact of higher commodity prices fades a little. While food makes up a relatively small part of the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation, it is the most visible form of price rises. Meanwhile, economists feel that the impact of some of the other higher costs firms have been passing on may be peaking. Economists expect inflation to fall back towards the 2% target next year. And remember, on average wage rises are comfortably outpacing inflation, so the cost-of-living squeeze is easing for many, even if it may not feel like it. Plus, traditionally these figures are used to uprate many benefits for working age people - some may see an increase of about 6% in their universal credit payments next spring. Following the release of the latest inflation figures, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was not satisfied with progress so far in bearing down on price rises. She went on to hint at help to come in November's Budget, with, we understand, some relief expected on energy bills. Businesses, however, remain cautious - some retailers are warning that further tax rises in the Budget may cause a resurgence in inflationary pressures. And until the Bank of England feels that inflation is firmly under control, it's always going to be cautious about cutting interest rates. So while there's still unlikely to be a cut in rates in November, analysts think there may be a growing chance of a \"Santa cut\" in December - just in time for Christmas.",

    "title": "First Thing : JD Vance expresses  great optimism  Gaza truce will hold during Israel visit | US news",
    "text": "Good morning. JD Vance has expressed “great optimism” over the Gaza truce plan, which he described as “durable” and “going better than expected” during a visit to Israel on Tuesday, two days after Israeli airstrikes killed 26 Palestinians. The vice-president’s trip, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to strengthen the ceasefire agreement, came as Hamas officials joined talks in Cairo aimed at bridging outstanding differences with Israel. Gaza’s media office said Israel had violated the ceasefire 80 times and killed at least 80 Palestinians since the agreement took effect. On Tuesday the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, condemned Israel’s “continued violation” of the ceasefire. - What are the ceasefire violations? On Sunday, Israel launched lethal airstrikes in Gaza that killed 26 Palestinians after two Israeli soldiers were killed in an attack the army blamed on Hamas. The militant group said it was not responsible because it had not had contact with fighters in the area since communications were cut off in March. The Israeli military later said it had resumed enforcing the ceasefire. - What is Israel alleging about Hamas? Israel has accused Hamas of delaying the return of hostages’ bodies. Hamas has sent back 15 bodies but still needs to hand over 13 more. The group has said locating the remains will take time as many are buried under rubble. Trump nominee to lead whistleblower office drops out after racist texts surface Paul Ingrassia, Donald Trump’s nominee to oversee federal whistleblower protections, has dropped out after racist text messages he sent surfaced this week. Ingrassia, a White House liaison at the Department of Homeland Security, allegedly described himself as having “a Nazi streak” and suggested Martin Luther King Jr Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell”, according to texts leaked by Politico on Monday. - What did Ingrassia say? “I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday’s HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,” he posted on Truth Social. - Why did he drop out? John Thune, the Senate majority leader, was asked if the administration should pull Ingrassia’s nomination. “I think so. He’s not going to pass,” Thune said on Monday. By late afternoon on Tuesday, at least five Senate Republicans told the Washington Post they opposed Ingrassia’s nomination. CIA playing ‘most important part’ in US strikes in the Caribbean, sources say The Central Intelligence Agency is providing the bulk of the intelligence used to carry out lethal airstrikes by the Trump administration against small, fast boats in the Caribbean Sea suspected of carrying drugs from Venezuela, according to three sources familiar with the operations. The CIA’s main role in the boat strikes has not previously been disclosed. The administration has publicly announced seven strikes since September without disclosing details other than the number of people killed and the allegation that the boats carried narcotics. - What is the CIA doing? The sources said the agency was providing real-time intelligence collected by satellites and signal intercepts to detect which boats it believes are loaded with drugs, tracking their routes and making recommendations about which vessels should be hit by missiles. - What does it mean for holding the administration to account? “They are going to claim it’s classified and they are not going to release it publicly,” said Mark Lowenthal, a former CIA assistant director for analysis.

    "title": "Mamdani rise in NYC reflects generational fight within the Democratic Party",
    "text": "When state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo faced off in the first New York City mayoral debate of the general election, the generational battle within the Democratic Party was on full display. Cuomo was long a member of Democratic royalty, leading New York as governor for nearly eleven years after serving in the Clinton administration. His late father Gov. Mario Cuomo was a Democratic Party icon. Again and again, Cuomo hammered the idea that his deep resume makes him uniquely qualified him to lead America's biggest city. \"This is no job for on-the-job training,\" Cuomo said during the Oct. 16 exchange, painting Mamdani as a political novice with left-leaning ideas outside the mainstream. \"He never has had a job. On his resume it said he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer.\" But Cuomo is running in this race as an independent after Mamdani, who turned 34 last weekend, trounced him during the Democratic Party primary. Mamdani was an unknown outside his state Assembly district until this year, but has led consistently in the general election by double-digit margins, according to polls. \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during the debate. \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\" That barb pointed to the downside of Cuomo's long track record in office: it comes with some gritty political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021. Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing. But Andres Bernal, a political analyst who lectures at the City University of New York, thinks many young voters look at Cuomo's history of controversy and are reminded of the Democratic Party establishment that has left them disillusioned. \"It's a revolving door, with a lot of corporate America, a lot of funders, and lobbyists,\" he said. Bernal says Mamdani overcame Cuomo's attacks over his relatively thin resume by offering big progressive ideas, like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, that appeal to many young voters. \"Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and I think are associated with Mamdani's youth,\" Bernal said. It seems to be working. The latest poll by AARP and Gotham Polling shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers, under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76 percent of his support is over age 50. But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and style. When asked during the debate whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal cannabis shops, Mamdani laughed and said Yes. Cuomo offered a terse No. Their starkly different tones have played out in social media, where Cuomo offered conventional campaign ads, often attacking Mamdani. Mamdani's campaign, meanwhile posts upbeat, often funny and hopeful videos that regularly go viral. \"Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate trying to do,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx. Polanco is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas. But he says Mamdani's use of social media to reach young voters is a game-changer, allowing him to overcome his relative lack of experience. \"He has rewritten the book, I love his style, he's a happy warrior,\" he said. During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging has gotten better since he lost the Democratic primary, but he acknowledged playing catch-up. \"I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now,\" he said. While Cuomo and Mamdani have sparred, often bitterly, across this generational party divide, the Republican in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has suggested they're closer on policy issues than their campaign rhetoric suggests. \"We have the architect and the apprentice,\" Sliwa said during the debate. Early voting is now underway. If Mamdani holds onto his lead through election day on Nov. 4, he will represent one more big generational change, serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but that hasn't appeared to slow Mamdani's momentum. Mamdani has picked up some key endorsements from Jewish leaders in the city and a New York Times-Siena poll last month found most young voters in New York City sympathize more with the Palestinians than with Israel over the war in Gaza.

    "title": "Parcels : Tiny Desk Concert",
    "text": "Parcels does not shy away from abundance. The Australian quintet's songs often feature a myriad of guitars, rivaling piano and synths, slinky basslines, pulsing drums and four (yes, four) vocalists. But the group opens its Tiny Desk concert with a secret weapon: hauntingly bare harmonies, backed only by gentle keys and guitar, that transform a snippet of the irresistibly catchy \"Leaveyourlove\" into a solemn oath of devotion. It's a stunningly stripped-down choice for a band that can — and does — properly rock out, with explosive live performances that turn its glossy, electro-pop studio albums into transcendental dance parties, collective rituals of movement and joy in which the crowd becomes a key sixth band member. But it's also a return to the band's roots. Parcels started out as a group of high school friends, jamming together in the idyllic seaside town of Byron Bay. After graduation, they relocated to Berlin, where their early days were spent busking on the streets, performing bluegrass covers of pop songs. At the Tiny Desk, evenly spaced out and in a ceaseless, mischievous musical dialogue with one another, Parcels' egalitarian ethos is front and center: There is no lead singer, there is no frontman. As an instrument-wielding boy band, the group converses with a fluidity that taps into the psychedelic playground of the Grateful Dead and dances into the hypnotic electronica of Giorgio Moroder. Sunlit melodies melt into one another; a cascade of soulful voices guides listeners from the early days of Parcels' discography to the magnetic bliss of the band's newly released album, LOVED. Both the record and the performance emanate the magic of spending a decade making art with your best pals.

    "title": "Trump uses  common sense  to make a political point . It has populist appeal",
    "text": "The idea of \"common sense\" has been central to American politics since the founding of the United States. Politicians still use the phrase all the time — and perhaps none more so than President Trump. Just this month at a Cabinet meeting, he used the phrase when he again recommended that pregnant women not take Tylenol. \"There's something going on, and we have to address it. And so, I'm addressing it the best I can as a nondoctor, but I'm a man of common sense,\" he said. He also used the term when he cast doubt on the monthly jobs report on CNBC in August: \"It's totally rigged. Smart people know it. People with common sense know it.\" The White House has also used it to explain the current government shutdown. \"Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently told NPR's Morning Edition. This isn't exactly new. \"Common sense\" is such a widely used political phrase that University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld wrote an entire book on it. And yet, she says, Trump's usage of it is unique. \"He uses it more than almost anybody else in American politics,\" she said. \"Although, of course, it has a really old origin story.\" That goes back to Thomas Paine, in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which made the case to the earliest Americans that British rule of the colonies was wrong. And in that, she says, Paine had hit upon the populist appeal of the phrase. \"It invokes some kind of primordial basic sense of ordinary people, a kind of lived experience that should transcend what the official or elite position is on something and particularly should transcend book learning and school learning,\" she said. And Trump often invokes that dichotomy of common sense vs. academic smarts. Speaking to military leaders in Quantico, Va., last month, Trump differentiated his administration from Joe Biden's, saying that Biden was surrounded by \"radical left lunatics that are brilliant people but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense.\" The phrase appeals more to several demographics that strongly align with Trump, says Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican strategist. \"Common sense is a higher priority to those who live in rural communities than those in the urban areas. Common sense does better among older voters than it does among younger voters,\" he said. \"And I think the reason why is that it reminds people of a more simple past.\" And that understandably appeals to people who want to make America great again. But Democrats use the phrase too. President Barack Obama tried to pass what he called \"common sense gun reform.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used it this year on her Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"I believe that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, if a person gets sick, they shouldn't go bankrupt. Common sense,\" she told a crowd at Arizona State University in March. One way to look at \"common sense\" is as an attempt to signal that a policy isn't extreme and could have broad appeal. But as Luntz points out, it can also be a cudgel, especially in Trump's hands. \"For him, common sense has an even broader meaning,\" he said. \"It's not just that you're right for the right reasons. It's also that the other side is wrong for being ideological, for being political or being outside the mainstream.\" Rosenfeld has a similar take. \"It's also potentially rather demagogic,\" she says of the phrase. \"Common sense also suggests not that there's another side to it. The other side in a debate with common sense is nonsense.\" And in that sense and others, common sense can be considered one of the most powerful pieces of rhetoric the MAGA movement has found. To Rosenfeld, Trump especially uses the phrase to try to excuse norm-shattering behavior — like a September social media post that Chicago was \"about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\" Here's how Trump explained that to a reporter: \"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war — that's common sense.\" \"Common sense\" gives the impression of timeworn policy ideas, even if the policy — mass deployment of the National Guard into U.S. cities — was previously unthinkable.

    "text": "Scientists are reporting the first compelling evidence in people that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines with age. A 10-week study of people 65 or older found that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day increased levels of the chemical messenger acetylcholine by 2.3% in a brain area involved in attention and memory. The increase \"is not huge,\" says Étienne de Villers-Sidani, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal. \"But it's significant, considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade normally just with aging.\" So, at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years. The chemical change observed after intensive brain training is persuasive, says Michael Hasselmo, director of the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University, who was not involved in the study. \"It was compelling enough that I thought, 'Maybe I need to be doing this,'\" he says. The result backs earlier research in animals showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. Studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can improve thinking and memory. Never skip brain day The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, comes amid a proliferation of online brain-training programs, including Lumosity, Elevate, Peak, CogniFit and BrainHQ. But it has been hard to know whether these programs really work, says de Villers-Sidani, who directs the cognitive disorders clinic at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute. \"They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures,\" he says, \"but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain and how is it changing the brain?\" So de Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's closely associated with cognitive performance. Acetylcholine levels typically begin a gradual decline around middle age. The levels drop sharply, though, in people with Alzheimer's disease. The team studied 92 healthy people who were 65 or older. Half the participants spent 30 minutes a day playing computer games like solitaire and Candy Crush. The others spent the same amount of time each day doing cognitive exercises that are part of the scientifically tested program BrainHQ. The program challenges users to remember the type and location of items that appear and disappear with increasing speed. \"It's really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and it kind of pushes you to the limit,\" de Villers-Sidani says. The researchers used a special kind of PET scan to detect changes in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors. \"I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest,\" de Villers-Sidani says. But they did. In people who played games like solitaire, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But in people who did cognitive training, there was a significant increase. Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory. Even modest changes are meaningful, Hasselmo says, because acetylcholine does more than carry messages in the brain. It also modulates the behavior of neurons in ways that affect learning, memory and attention. So when a person takes, say, a high dose of the motion sickness drug scopolamine — which blocks the effects of acetylcholine — things start to go awry. \"If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain, a person can't even think,\" Hasselmo says. \"You go into a delirious state.\" On the other hand, even small increases in acetylcholine can have a \"profound and notable effect\" on memory and thinking in older people. Hasselmo notes that the earliest Alzheimer's drugs reduced symptoms by increasing levels of acetylcholine. Now, he says, intensive brain training has the potential to achieve similar gains and stave off cognitive decline. Copyright 2025 NPR",

    "title": "The federal government is still shut down . Here what that means across the country",
    "text": "It's Day 22 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it. Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls \"Democrat programs.\" As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans. Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true. Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies. In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown. — Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR Will the military get paid on Oct. 29? The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday. Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees. Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order What about WIC and SNAP benefits? Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states continue to fund the program. The White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding. Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October. That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance. USDA earlier this month told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, \"until further notice.\" — Jennifer Ludden, NPR And what about school lunches? Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals. Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown. \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\" According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist. — Kadin Mills, NPR USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,\" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late. Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\" Noem posted on X on Thursday. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" – which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a post earlier this week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. — Ximena Bustillo, NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country. Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A \"slight increase\" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos. Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown from NPR's Joel Rose. The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region. Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country: Alaska - The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media] - About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media] For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media. Arizona - Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ] - Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU] - Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ] - Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ] California - The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED] Colorado - Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio] - In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio] - Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio] Connecticut - Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU] - Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. [WSHU] Georgia - For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB] - Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sentitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR] Kansas - If the federal government shutdown continues, the Mid-America Regional Council said it may need to temporarily close Head Start centers serving more than 2,300 Kansas City children beginning Nov. 1. [KCUR] - Kansas farmers face several uncertainties, as payments from some federal programs are in limbo. In addition, nearly half of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's employees will be furloughed, and many offices will be closed. [KCUR] - During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR] For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR. Louisiana - The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF] For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF. Illinois - Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media] Maine - Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it was a popular weekend at the park. [Maine Public] Minnesota - Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News] Missouri - Families enrolled in the Missouri WIC program — which provides supplemental food, nutrition education and support to low-income women and children — will not be immediately impacted by the shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio] - The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio] New Hampshire - There are more than 5,000 civilian federal employees in New Hampshire, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Manchester VA Medical Center, the White Mountain National Forest, the Berlin federal prison, the passport processing center at Pease and at other federal agencies. How the shutdown might affect them isn't entirely clear. [NHPR] - The White Mountain National Forest will remain open, but some say earlier staff cuts are hampering critical activities. Firefighting and disaster response activities will also continue, according to federal officials. [NHPR] - On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\" [NPR] For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR. North Dakota - The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public] For more on the impact in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public. Oklahoma - With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story. [KOSU] Oregon - The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB] Pennsylvania - Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF] Tennessee - On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN] Texas - U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media] Utah - In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER) Washington - On Oct. 6, state officials say they have enough to cover WIC for the next two weeks. Seattle and King County have partnered to dedicate nearly $2 million to provide one-time vouchers to an estimated 30,000 clients in King County who rely on WIC. [KUOW] - The Employment Security Department says the 80,000 federal workers in Washington State may qualify for unemployment benefits. [OPB] Wyoming - On Oct. 3, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wyoming will cover gaps in funding to federally funded state employees who are in the state budget \"in the short-term.\" [Wyoming Public Media] For more on the impact in Wyoming, head to Wyoming Public Media.
