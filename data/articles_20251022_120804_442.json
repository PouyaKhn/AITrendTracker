    "title": "Inside the illegal eel trade : is there a way to stop Europe biggest wildlife crime before it too late ? | Illegal wildlife trade",
    "text": "By 10am on the midsummer Day of the Ox, the city of Narita smells of charcoal and sugar. The cobbled road is thronged with visitors lining up to buy grilled eel, a traditional delicacy believed to cool the body and keep spirits up in the humid weather. “We’ll be so sad if it becomes extinct and we can’t eat eel any more,” says a customer sitting on the tatami-mat floor in Kawatoyo, a popular restaurant specialising in grilled eel, which has been operating for more than 115 years. For the past decade, he and his wife have driven for two hours to be part of this midsummer celebration, along with thousands of other Japanese people across the archipelago. His fear is well founded. Of the 286,000 tonnes of eel eaten globally, 99% are American, Japanese and European eels, according to a recent study by Chuo University. They are listed as endangered – and critically endangered, in the case of European eels – by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their numbers have plummeted due to habitat loss, pollution and the climate crisis – but also due to a thriving illegal trade in European eels. Worth about €2.5bn (£2.1bn) a year, eel trafficking is Europe’s biggest wildlife crime. “If there is a demand, there will be trafficking,” says José Antonio Alfaro Moreno, lead of Europol’s anti-eel trafficking operation. Despite a ban on eel exports from Europe 15 years ago, the fish are still ending up on plates around the globe – but in particular in Asia. More than half of seizures of European eel between 2011 and 2018 were destined for China, a country that accounts for 70% of the world’s total eel exports. Japan is one of the largest consumers of eels globally and in 2024, an estimated 73% of the eel consumed in Japan was imported, according to the Japanese Fisheries Agency. So how has such a large illegal trade been allowed to prosper and what is being done? To find out, more than 50 scientists, eel farmers, brokers, environmental activists, law enforcement officers, criminologists and eel importers were interviewed across Japan, Spain, Italy and France. International trade data, photographs and documents relating to the illegal trade were also analysed. Traceability The scale of the illegal trade did not really become clear until 2016 when Hong Kong authorities intercepted luggage filled with plastic bags of live fish and asked Dr David Baker of Hong Kong University to develop an eDNA test to identify exactly what it was. Baker discovered these writhing bags were filled with European eels. “It hit me like a ton of bricks that a critically endangered species is on the shelf at all these commercial retail outlets [outside Europe],” says Baker, who found that 45% of convenience store eels in Hong Kong were European. Baker shared his genetic test with authorities globally. Similar eDNA toolkits are used now around the world to test eel shipments, including in a 2022 case in the US. But, it is only one tool. Since the 1990s, many seafood products have become part of a traceable digital chain that can be followed from fisher to consumer. But there is no global system for eels. “There is no traceability,” says Dr Hiromi Shiraishi of Chuo University. She says that even for Japanese importers who are trying to do their best and only source legal eels, “it is very difficult to determine where these eels originally came from”. As a result, in 2017, Europol launched the Operation Lake taskforce with one goal: stop eel traffickers. Investigators focused on poaching hotspots: France, Spain, Portugal and the UK. But as soon as one network was discovered, another emerged. Today, police chase traffickers across 30 countries, working with local authorities. “The new trend is the African route,” says Moreno. Glass eels (the transparent, finger-sized, juvenile stage of European eels) are flown or ferried into Morocco, Mauritania or Senegal, where they can be “cleaned” into legal exports towards Asia. These transit countries also allow traffickers to refresh shipments, including changing water, at a lower cost than in Europe. Scientists are employed to keep the eels’ death rate at 1% of the total shipment. “It is incredible how good they are at doing their job,” says Moreno. “It is because it is a lot of money.” Smuggling methods also evolve. During Covid, when airport security relaxed, eels were hidden in suitcases – one “mule” could carry 50kg spread across three bags. Now, the bigger profits are in fresh cargo shipments. Packed between mussels or frozen meat, a single shipment can conceal 500kg of glass eels. The latest iteration of Operation Lake ran from October 2024 to June 2025, with 16,131 inspections across Europe, resulting in 26 arrests and 22 tonnes of glass eels seized. But despite such arrests over the years, traffickers remain one step ahead, their routes as slippery as the fish themselves. Trafficking In Landes, a department next to the French Basque country, Joseba Aguirrebarrena is at work checking his square tanks, whose surface water is disrupted by a constantly aerating pump for the thousands and thousands of writhing eels. These eels are sourced from the nearby Adour River, where the handful of remaining eel fishers set up their fine-mesh sieves on the banks of the gushing waters under moonlight. Aguirrebarrena, one of only three glass-eel brokers left in France, buys eels from fishers across France’s Atlantic coast and sells them on to other farms, restaurants or individuals across Europe, mainly to Spanish cooks and breeders in northern Europe, or for repopulation programmes across the EU. Others will raise the fish until they are ready to be consumed – legally – across Europe, where they are still celebrated, despite their decline. In the Basque region, for example, glass eels are prepared with olive oil and garlic for the San Sebastián feast day, while in Italy’s Po River delta, adult eels are sliced and grilled with salt, or added to a risotto. The constant attempts by European authorities to crack down on the illegal eel trade means that everyone involved in the industry, including Aguirrebarrena himself, has faced litigation at some point, suspected of either selling the eels to traffickers or not having official documentation for their eels. This frustrates and concerns Aguirrebarrena and his son, who runs the business with him. Neither see trafficking as the main threat to the eel. “For us, is it important for the ministry and the state to realise that there are other problems [than cracking down on fishers and traders],” says Ibai Aguirrebarrena Mendiboure, his son. The pair are asking the government to stop dam projects and to “stop wastewater pollution”. Aguirrebarrena Sr estimates that eels have lost 70% of their habitat in the past 40 years. As a result, some would like to see European countries take firm action by following guidance from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices) to temporarily close eel fisheries across the continent. “Ministers ignore repeatedly every year this advice of zero catches,” says Javier Lopez, of the environmental organisation Oceana. But not everyone – including the Aguirrebarrenas who have a business to maintain – thinks eels are best protected by closing fisheries. In 2023, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) advised countries that eel fishing should remain partly open so that fishers can help maintain habitats. Eleonora Ciccotti, eel scientist and specialist at the University of Rome, who found that rivers are suffering from damming, degradation, water pollution and loss of habitat, agrees with that analysis. “If there is not a fishery, nobody will maintain the channel because it is expensive, complicated,” she says. Meanwhile, many of the eels that are left continue to be poached from rivers and sold to traffickers for prices beyond what fishers can achieve selling legally in Europe. What has further complicated matters is that, as a species, eels are sometimes treated differently by different countries. These anomalies are exploited by eel traffickers. “It is reasonably easy to understand when cocaine is being trafficked or drugs are being trafficked because they are illegal everywhere,” says Dr Mònica Pons Hernández, an environmental criminologist at Bergen University. Pons Hernández says the eels’ legal place in the market “jeopardises absolutely everything”. Saving the eels In November, at a conference in Uzbekistan focused on protection of endangered species, the European Union, along with Honduras, will sponsor a vote to enhance the protection of all Anguilla eel species, which would include Japanese and American eels, in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) wildlife protection treaty. Proponents say this change to the treaty would limit the ability of traffickers to pretend that European eel is American eel. But it would also mean that all eel shipments globally would require additional export permits, something that eel industry advocates say would increase costs and create unnecessary paperwork. Asia, especially Japan, is pushing back. “The EU proposal … is really unfair,” says Shinya Matsuura, president of the Japanese Eel Importers Association, who will travel to the conference to lobby against the proposal. Pointing to 2025’s bumper crop of Japanese baby eels reported across China, Korea and Japan, the association feels that Asian countries have been able to manage their stocks appropriately while Europe failed to do so. After a decade of conservation, law enforcement and trade agreements have failed to stop European eel trafficking, one avenue of hope is that the rise of the conscientious consumer will result in diners actively seeking out homegrown eels. “My dream is to make Narita unagi [eel],” says Kosumi Ito, the third-generation owner of Kawatoyo restaurant in the city, in Japan’s Chiba prefecture. At his restaurants, every eel is cut from head to tail, in the Chiba style, by a dedicated filleter who has trained for years in the tradition. Faced with the decline of local eel, Ito recently embarked on a new venture: raising eels at one of his restaurant locations. “We want to go back to our history – let’s eat the unagi that we catch in Chiba.” But for others, conservation seems futile. “The only end of the glass eels trafficking, as far as I see, is the extermination of European eel,” says Europol’s Moreno. “Because if you don’t have anything to fish, you don’t have anything to smuggle.” - Additional reporting by Alice Facchini and Sofia Nardacchione in Italy. - This investigation was developed with the support of Journalismfund Europe.",

    "title": "There is a fascinating TV series to be made about a menopausal rock band – Riot Women isnt it | Tiff Bakker",
    "text": "There’s a moment in the first episode of Riot Women, the latest drama from the acclaimed writer-director Sally Wainwright, best known for Happy Valley, when a group of menopausal women are debating what songs they should cover in their newly formed menopausal rock band. Joanna Scanlan’s uptight and depressed Beth decides the Rolling Stones’ (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction – a song released in 1965 – might make a cool pick for this bunch of middle-aged punk rockers who, until now, seem to have heard of only Abba. “Can you imagine, Satisfaction being sung by women of a certain age? Isn’t that interesting?” beams Beth with surprise, as if women over the age of 40 have suddenly forgotten what it’s like to have an orgasm. “It’s funny because we’re women. It’s poignant, like we’re still up for it.” “Fine, let’s all sing a song that makes us look like a bunch of lesbians,” chimes in Amelia Bullmore’s Yvonne. If only Wainwright had made these women a “bunch of lesbians” then we might have had a show rooted in some kind of reality rather than another variation on The Full Monty (and not in a good way). Instead of pasty men dancing to Hot Chocolate, we get WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE forming a riot grrrl-type punk rock band. Writers can write about things they don’t know about, of course, but there surely must be a line. Riot Women uses a seminal moment in music history as a minor plot device because Wainwright doesn’t know enough about it to skim past the surface. Instead, she barely references it at all, the closest thing being the use of riot-grrrl adjacent band Hole’s song Violet throughout the show and Kitty (Rosalie Craig) sporting a replica of Courtney Love’s iconic Let it Bleed tattoo down the inside of her arm. Whereas other Wainwright shows have a core truthfulness that emanates from the TV, Riot Women never reaches anything approaching those kinds of heights because it feels so utterly superficial. The real thing was anything but. The riot grrrl movement began in the early 1990s in the US’s Pacific north-west in cities such as Seattle, Portland and Olympia, and was a feminist punk movement that used DIY zines, music and political activism to fight back against sexism, homophobia, misogyny and racism. It was a scene where girls got to be in the bands and in the front row - at Bikini Kill shows, Kathleen Hanna would urge “all girls to the front”. By contrast, the sensibility behind Riot Women, the TV show, feels straight, suburban and staunchly conventional – the very opposite of the music scene it claims to be celebrating. Riot grrrl was created by women who rejected those very tenets. A significant part of that was the scene’s queerness both on stage and in the crowd, and there were queer members of seminal riot grrrl bands such as Bikini Kill, 7 Year Bitch and The Butchies, and in grunge and rock bands emerging at about the same time that were influenced by the sound or politics of the movement, like L7 and Hole. Lesbians have always been invisible to society, but riot grrrl gave us a voice, and it gave us a place to go, to feel safe. The scene was inclusive, erasing the divide between audience and artist. A generation of young women came of age and came out to this music. In Riot Women, the music that should be at its core is merely a flimsy framework for a series about middle-aged straight women who are annoyed with the shitty men who’ve left them, the shitty adult sons (and daughters) they’ve raised, and the difficulties of dealing with ageing parents. They also seem to think rock music is accessible only to men. “It would’ve been OK if we were lads,” says Lorraine Ashbourne’s Jess, the purple-haired bartender with a heart of gold, whose musical rock dreams were dashed as a youngster on account of her gender. (Patti Smith, Joan Jett, Stevie Nicks, Janis Joplin, Chrissie Hynde and Pat Benatar must not have made it to northern England.) Wainwright has used all the trappings and accessories that indicate a queer scene; the show is set in the very gay Hebden Bridge, and much of the action takes place in a pub awash with Pride flags. But it all feels like window dressing because Wainwright has not managed to write one central queer character despite creating a show about a movement rooted in that history. Instead, she has written marginal characters such as Jess’s trans daughter, and another daughter who has three kids with two men until she runs off with a woman (“She’s not gay!” yelps Jess). Then there’s the younger lesbian cop-turned-backing singer who gets badly beaten up by a male colleague. Wainwright must have missed the memo that gay characters have a history of being killed off and abused on screen, and we’re sick of it. Wainwright often dips her toe into lesbian culture. She created Gentleman Jack, the story of the “unconventional” Anne Lister, and then of course the beloved Last Tango in Halifax, which has a lesbian couple at its centre. But Wainwright has completely missed the mark on this one. It all feels very much like the butt of a joke, cartoonish and not centred in any emotional realism at all. I wanted to like Riot Women, I really did, but to see something so important to the people who lived it reduced to a bit of a joke and a bad punk fancy-dress party left a bitter taste. By the end of the show, I was so full of my own perimenopausal rage, I barely needed anesthesia when I fronted up at the dentist for a root canal. Then again, in Wainwright’s world, I probably just needed a good old dose of “the HRT”. - Tiff Bakker is a New York-based writer who specialises in arts and culture",

    "title": "Mamdani rise in NYC reflects generational fight within the Democratic Party",
    "text": "Mamdani's rise in NYC reflects generational fight within the Democratic Party When state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo faced off in the first New York City mayoral debate of the general election, the generational battle within the Democratic Party was on full display. Cuomo was long a member of Democratic royalty, leading New York as governor for nearly eleven years after serving in the Clinton administration. His late father Gov. Mario Cuomo was a Democratic Party icon. Again and again, Cuomo hammered the idea that his deep resume makes him uniquely qualified him to lead America's biggest city. \"This is no job for on-the-job training,\" Cuomo said during the Oct. 16 exchange, painting Mamdani as a political novice with left-leaning ideas outside the mainstream. \"He never has had a job. On his resume it said he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer.\" But Cuomo is running in this race as an independent after Mamdani, who turned 34 last weekend, trounced him during the Democratic Party primary. Mamdani was an unknown outside his state Assembly district until this year, but has led consistently in the general election by double-digit margins, according to polls. \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during the debate. \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\" That barb pointed to the downside of Cuomo's long track record in office: it comes with some gritty political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021. Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing. But Andres Bernal, a political analyst who lectures at the City University of New York, thinks many young voters look at Cuomo's history of controversy and are reminded of the Democratic Party establishment that has left them disillusioned. \"It's a revolving door, with a lot of corporate America, a lot of funders, and lobbyists,\" he said. Bernal says Mamdani overcame Cuomo's attacks over his relatively thin resume by offering big progressive ideas, like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, that appeal to many young voters. \"Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and I think are associated with Mamdani's youth,\" Bernal said. It seems to be working. The latest poll by AARP and Gotham Polling shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers, under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76 percent of his support is over age 50. But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and style. When asked during the debate whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal cannabis shops, Mamdani laughed and said Yes. Cuomo offered a terse No. Their starkly different tones have played out in social media, where Cuomo offered conventional campaign ads, often attacking Mamdani. Mamdani's campaign, meanwhile posts upbeat, often funny and hopeful videos that regularly go viral. \"Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate trying to do,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx. Polanco is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas. But he says Mamdani's use of social media to reach young voters is a game-changer, allowing him to overcome his relative lack of experience. \"He has rewritten the book, I love his style, he's a happy warrior,\" he said. During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging has gotten better since he lost the Democratic primary, but he acknowledged playing catch-up. \"I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now,\" he said. While Cuomo and Mamdani have sparred, often bitterly, across this generational party divide, the Republican in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has suggested they're closer on policy issues than their campaign rhetoric suggests. \"We have the architect and the apprentice,\" Sliwa said during the debate. Early voting is now underway. If Mamdani holds onto his lead through election day on Nov. 4, he will represent one more big generational change, serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but that hasn't appeared to slow Mamdani's momentum. Mamdani has picked up some key endorsements from Jewish leaders in the city and a New York Times-Siena poll last month found most young voters in New York City sympathize more with the Palestinians than with Israel over the war in Gaza.",

    "title": "The federal government is still shut down . Here what that means in your community : NPR",
    "text": "The federal government is still shut down. Here's what that means across the country It's Day 22 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it. Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls \"Democrat programs.\" As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans. Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true. Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies. In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown. — Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR Will the military get paid on Oct. 29? The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday. Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees. Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order What about WIC and SNAP benefits? Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states continue to fund the program. The White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding. Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October. That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance. USDA earlier this month told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, \"until further notice.\" — Jennifer Ludden, NPR And what about school lunches? Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals. Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown. \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\" According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist. — Kadin Mills, NPR USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,\" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late. Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\" Noem posted on X on Thursday. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" – which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a post earlier this week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. — Ximena Bustillo, NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country. Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A \"slight increase\" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos. Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown from NPR's Joel Rose. The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region. Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country: Alaska - The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media] - About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media] For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media. Arizona - Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ] - Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU] - Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ] - Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ] California - The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED] Colorado - Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio] - In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio] - Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio] Connecticut - Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU] - Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. [WSHU] Georgia - For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB] - Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sentitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR] Kansas - If the federal government shutdown continues, the Mid-America Regional Council said it may need to temporarily close Head Start centers serving more than 2,300 Kansas City children beginning Nov. 1. [KCUR] - Kansas farmers face several uncertainties, as payments from some federal programs are in limbo. In addition, nearly half of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's employees will be furloughed, and many offices will be closed. [KCUR] - During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR] For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR. Louisiana - The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF] For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF. Illinois - Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media] Maine - Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it was a popular weekend at the park. [Maine Public] Minnesota - Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News] Missouri - Families enrolled in the Missouri WIC program — which provides supplemental food, nutrition education and support to low-income women and children — will not be immediately impacted by the shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio] - The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio] New Hampshire - There are more than 5,000 civilian federal employees in New Hampshire, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Manchester VA Medical Center, the White Mountain National Forest, the Berlin federal prison, the passport processing center at Pease and at other federal agencies. How the shutdown might affect them isn't entirely clear. [NHPR] - The White Mountain National Forest will remain open, but some say earlier staff cuts are hampering critical activities. Firefighting and disaster response activities will also continue, according to federal officials. [NHPR] - On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\" [NPR] For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR. North Dakota - The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public] For more on the impact in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public. Oklahoma - With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story. [KOSU] Oregon - The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB] Pennsylvania - Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF] Tennessee - On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN] Texas - U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media] Utah - In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER) Washington - On Oct. 6, state officials say they have enough to cover WIC for the next two weeks. Seattle and King County have partnered to dedicate nearly $2 million to provide one-time vouchers to an estimated 30,000 clients in King County who rely on WIC. [KUOW] - The Employment Security Department says the 80,000 federal workers in Washington State may qualify for unemployment benefits. [OPB] Wyoming - On Oct. 3, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wyoming will cover gaps in funding to federally funded state employees who are in the state budget \"in the short-term.\" [Wyoming Public Media] For more on the impact in Wyoming, head to Wyoming Public Media.

    "title": "Trump uses  common sense  to make a political point : NPR",
    "text": "Trump uses 'common sense' to make a political point. It has populist appeal The idea of \"common sense\" has been central to American politics since the founding of the United States. Politicians still use the phrase all the time — and perhaps none more so than President Trump. Just this month at a Cabinet meeting, he used the phrase when he again recommended that pregnant women not take Tylenol. \"There's something going on, and we have to address it. And so, I'm addressing it the best I can as a nondoctor, but I'm a man of common sense,\" he said. He also used the term when he cast doubt on the monthly jobs report on CNBC in August: \"It's totally rigged. Smart people know it. People with common sense know it.\" The White House has also used it to explain the current government shutdown. \"Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently told NPR's Morning Edition. This isn't exactly new. \"Common sense\" is such a widely used political phrase that University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld wrote an entire book on it. And yet, she says, Trump's usage of it is unique. \"He uses it more than almost anybody else in American politics,\" she said. \"Although, of course, it has a really old origin story.\" That goes back to Thomas Paine, in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which made the case to the earliest Americans that British rule of the colonies was wrong. And in that, she says, Paine had hit upon the populist appeal of the phrase. \"It invokes some kind of primordial basic sense of ordinary people, a kind of lived experience that should transcend what the official or elite position is on something and particularly should transcend book learning and school learning,\" she said. And Trump often invokes that dichotomy of common sense vs. academic smarts. Speaking to military leaders in Quantico, Va., last month, Trump differentiated his administration from Joe Biden's, saying that Biden was surrounded by \"radical left lunatics that are brilliant people but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense.\" The phrase appeals more to several demographics that strongly align with Trump, says Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican strategist. \"Common sense is a higher priority to those who live in rural communities than those in the urban areas. Common sense does better among older voters than it does among younger voters,\" he said. \"And I think the reason why is that it reminds people of a more simple past.\" And that understandably appeals to people who want to make America great again. But Democrats use the phrase too. President Barack Obama tried to pass what he called \"common sense gun reform.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used it this year on her Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"I believe that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, if a person gets sick, they shouldn't go bankrupt. Common sense,\" she told a crowd at Arizona State University in March. One way to look at \"common sense\" is as an attempt to signal that a policy isn't extreme and could have broad appeal. But as Luntz points out, it can also be a cudgel, especially in Trump's hands. \"For him, common sense has an even broader meaning,\" he said. \"It's not just that you're right for the right reasons. It's also that the other side is wrong for being ideological, for being political or being outside the mainstream.\" Rosenfeld has a similar take. \"It's also potentially rather demagogic,\" she says of the phrase. \"Common sense also suggests not that there's another side to it. The other side in a debate with common sense is nonsense.\" And in that sense and others, common sense can be considered one of the most powerful pieces of rhetoric the MAGA movement has found. To Rosenfeld, Trump especially uses the phrase to try to excuse norm-shattering behavior — like a September social media post that Chicago was \"about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\" Here's how Trump explained that to a reporter: \"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war — that's common sense.\" \"Common sense\" gives the impression of timeworn policy ideas, even if the policy — mass deployment of the National Guard into U.S. cities — was previously unthinkable.",

    "title": "Japan says it plans to tell Trump it will build up military and upgrade security strategy",
    "text": "TOKYO — Japan’s new foreign minister said Wednesday that his country plans to show its determination to further build up its defense to rapidly adapt to changing warfare realities and growing tension in the region when President Donald Trump visits Tokyo next week. Trump is expected to hold talks next Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office Tuesday after being elected as Japan’s first female leader. Takaichi, who had spent much of the past few weeks embroiled in internal political wrangling, has to face major diplomatic tests within days of taking office — Trump and two regional summits. “We are firmly preparing for President Trump’s visit,” Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said. Motegi said he hoped Trump’s first meeting with Takaichi during his Oct. 27-29 visit would serve as an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss further strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance while fostering their personal relationship of trust. He said Japan also hopes to further cooperate with South Korea, along with other regional partners including Australia and the Philippines, while seeking stable and constructive relations with China. Japan is currently undergoing a five-year military buildup through 2027 as part of its national security strategy, including doubling its annual defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product. The strategy that promotes Japan’s strike-back capability with long-range missiles marks a major break from Japan’s defense-only principle under its postwar pacifist constitution. The governing party’s alliance with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party that replaces the dovish centrist Komeito party has raised concern that a revised strategy may involve further offensive roles for Japan under Takaichi, a security hawk. Motegi said Japan’s further strengthening of its military capability is essential in order to adapt to emerging new warfare such as drone swarms in the war against Ukraine, as well as responses to cyberattacks. While firmly pursuing the ongoing five-year military buildup, the government will also review it, “and we hope to firmly convey our plans to the U.S. side,” Motegi said. Japan is expected to face tough demands from Trump to further increase its defense spending to NATO levels of 5% of GDP, more purchases of costly American arsenals and additional spending for some 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan under the bilateral security pact. “Our national defense should be based on our own independent decision,” Motegi said. “What’s important is not the amount or the GDP ratio but what’s in it.” He also said he hopes to meet with his counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, at the earliest time possible to discuss further strengthening of the deterrence and response capability of the Japan-U.S. alliance. Motegi returns to the post for the second time after serving in 2019-2021, during Trump’s first term, when he earned a reputation as a tough negotiator. He is also tasked with following up on the Japan-U.S. tariff agreement. He said he hoped to work toward “sincere and steady implementation of the agreement” to promote and ensure mutual benefits, economic security and growth.",

    "text": "Taiwan reports its first case of African swine fever and culls scores of pigs Taiwan reported its first cases of African swine fever, and authorities culled at least 195 pigs and ordered a ban on the movement and slaughter of pigs across the island TAIPEI, Taiwan -- TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan reported its first cases of African swine fever on Wednesday and culled at least 195 pigs from the affected farm. Authorities also ordered a ban on the movement and slaughter of pigs across the island. The Ministry of Agriculture said that samples from dead pigs from a farm in the coastal city of Taichung had tested positive for African swine fever on Tuesday. Animal protection and quarantine authorities immediately went to the farm and “preventively culled 195 pigs,” the ministry said. The authorities then supervised the cleaning and disinfection of the farm and established a control zone with a radius of 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from its center. Authorities also ordered a five-day ban on the movement and slaughtering of pigs across the island, starting at noon on Wednesday. Taiwan will isolate the virus strain before officially reporting it to the World Organization of Animal Health, Agriculture Minister Chen Junne-jih told a news conference. “Virus isolation takes two weeks, but we can’t wait,” Chen added. “We must implement the highest standards to prevent and control this suspected case of African swine fever.” African swine fever, which is nearly always fatal to swine, does not affect humans or other animals outside of the pig family. This is Taiwan’s first-ever reported case of the virus, Chen said. The island prohibits bringing in any meat or meat products without proper inspection and quarantine, with fines up to 1 million Taiwan dollars (about $32,500). “The most likely route of transmission is from outside Taiwan, through the illegal importation of pork products, which ultimately find their way to pig farms through food waste systems,” Chen added. In 2019, millions of pigs were culled in China and Vietnam as the virus spread through Asia. Currently, the only Asian country with a confirmed ongoing African swine fever outbreak is South Korea, according to the World Organization of Animal Health's October report on the virus situation worldwide. Twelve countries in Europe are also battling the virus. ___ Associated Press video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",

    "text": "What to know about efforts to block National Guard deployments in Chicago, Portland, other US cities President Donald Trump’s attempts to deploy the military in Democratic-led cities _ over the objections of mayors and governors _ has brought a head-spinning array of court challenges and overlapping rulings CHICAGO -- CHICAGO (AP) — President Donald Trump’s attempts to deploy the military in Democratic-led cities — over the objections of mayors and governors — has brought a head-spinning array of court challenges and overlapping rulings. As the U.S. Supreme Court ponders whether to clear the way for the National Guard in Chicago, a federal appeals court is hearing arguments in California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s challenge to the deployment of troops in Los Angeles. Guard troops could also soon be on the ground in Portland, Oregon, pending legal developments there. Here are some things to know about legal efforts to block, or deploy, National Guard troops in various cities. A federal judge in Chicago already blocked deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area for two weeks. On Wednesday, she'll hold a hearing to consider whether to extend that order — but anything she does could be moot if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the meantime. Attorneys representing the Trump administration said in court filings Tuesday that they would agree to possibly extend the block on deployment of troops for 30 days. However, they are also continuing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The Trump administration is pressing for an emergency order from the U.S. Supreme Court that would allow Guard troops to be deployed. “Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday. Lawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked that the Supreme Court continue to block the deployment to the Chicago area, calling it a “dramatic step.” An appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but for now a separate court order blocks him from actually deploying them. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders early this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up the Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any National Guard members to Oregon at all, after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead. The Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the administration. However, Immergut’s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed. The case is still before the courts. A panel of judges with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena is set to hear arguments Wednesday related to Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. A district court found the Trump administration violated federal law when he sent the troops to Los Angeles in early June after protests to his immigration crackdown. Judge Charles Breyer handed Newsom an early victory in the case on June 13 when he ordered control of National Guard troops back to California. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds. The appeals court will weigh whether to vacate Breyer’s June order. The same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration’s appeal to a Sept. 2 ruling by Breyer who found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws. In Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups who want to block the deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation’s capital supporting Trump’s initiative since late August. In Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to try to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” but only with the blessing of state lawmakers. Since their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power. ___ Associated Press writers Gene Johnson in Seattle, Mark Sherman in Washington, D.C., Olga R.

    "title": "OpenAI launches Atlas browser to compete with Google Chrome",
    "text": "OpenAI launches Atlas browser to compete with Google Chrome OpenAI has introduced its own web browser, ChatGPT Atlas, putting it in direct competition with Google OpenAI introduced its own web browser, Atlas, on Tuesday, putting the ChatGPT maker in direct competition with Google as more internet users rely on artificial intelligence to answer their questions. Making its popular AI chatbot a gateway to online searches could allow OpenAI, the world's most valuable startup, to pull in more internet traffic and the revenue made from digital advertising. It could also further cut off the lifeblood of online publishers if ChatGPT so effectively feeds people summarized information that they stop exploring the internet and clicking on traditional web links. OpenAI has said ChatGPT already has more than 800 million users but many of them get it for free. The San Francisco-based company also sells paid subscriptions but is losing more money than it makes and has been looking for ways to turn a profit. OpenAI said Atlas launches Tuesday on Apple laptops and will later come to Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s iOS phone operating system and Google’s Android phone system. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a “rare, once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about and how to use one.” But analyst Paddy Harrington of market research group Forrester said it will be a big challenge “competing with a giant who has ridiculous market share.” OpenAI’s browser is coming out just a few months after one of its executives testified that the company would be interested in buying Google’s industry-leading Chrome browser if a federal judge had required it to be sold to prevent the abuses that resulted in Google’s ubiquitous search engine being declared an illegal monopoly. But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last month issued a decision that rejected the Chrome sale sought by the U.S. Justice Department in the monopoly case, partly because he believed advances in the AI industry already are reshaping the competitive landscape. OpenAI’s browser will face a daunting challenge against Chrome, which has amassed about 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features from Google’s Gemini technology. Chrome’s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat. But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market. Microsoft ended up abandoning Explorer and introducing its Edge browser, which operates similarly to Chrome and holds a distant third place in market share behind Apple's Safari. Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup. Altman said he expects a chatbot interface to replace a traditional browser’s URL bar as the center of how he hopes people will use the internet in the future. “Tabs were great, but we haven’t seen a lot of browser innovation since then,” he said on a video presentation aired Tuesday. A premium feature of the ChatGPT Atlas browser is an “agent mode” that accesses the laptop and effectively clicks around the internet on the person’s behalf, armed with a users’ browser history and what they are seeking to learn and explaining its process as it searches. “It’s using the internet for you,” Altman said. Harrington, the Forrester analyst, says another way of thinking about that is it's “taking personality away from you.” “Your profile will be personally attuned to you based on all the information sucked up about you. OK, scary,” Harrington said. “But is it really you, really what you're thinking, or what that engine decides it's going to do? ... And will it add in preferred solutions based on ads?” About 60% of Americans overall — and 74% of those under 30 — use AI to find information at least some of the time, making online searches one of the most popular uses of AI technology, according to findings from an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken over the summer. Google since last year has automatically provided AI-generated responses that attempt to answer a person’s search query, appearing at the top of results. Reliance on AI chatbots to summarize information they collect online has raised a number of concerns, including the technology's propensity to confidently spout false information, a problem known as hallucination. The way that chatbots trained on online content spout new writings has been particularly troubling to the news industry, leading The New York Times and other outlets to sue OpenAI for copyright infringement and others, including The Associated Press, to sign licensing deals. A study of four top AI assistants including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini released Wednesday showed nearly half their responses were flawed and fell short of the standards of “high-quality” journalism. The research from the European Broadcasting Union, a group of public broadcasters in 56 countries, compiled the results of more than 3,000 responses to news-related questions to help ascertain quality responses and identify problems to fix. —— Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed to this story.",

    "title": "Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky is remembered as a leader in the game online surge",
    "text": "Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky is remembered as a leader in the game's online surge Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky has died at the age of 29 Daniel Naroditsky, a 29-year-old standard-bearer in the world of competitive speed chess that flourished in the COVID-19 pandemic, died over the weekend and leaves behind a legacy as one of the greats of the game who helped usher in its digital era. The American grandmaster won several championships and amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms, where he would livestream matches and explain strategy in real time. But he also struggled with the cyberspace he helped build. High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage. Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months. Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday. The cause of death has not been made public. “Danya was not only a brilliant grandmaster, but also a tireless ambassador for chess, and above all — a kind, compassionate and truly good person,” said Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation. The unsubstantiated claims of cheating came from from Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had called one of the “heroes” he looked up to as a kid. Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches. “Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,” Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.” He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity. Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people. Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X. Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause. Naroditsky became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from World Chess Champion, at the age of 18. He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and was a top 25 blitz player, winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. He spent much of his time training young players. “Daniel was an incredible teacher and explainer of chess and concepts and ideas,” said Daniel Weissbarth, a renowned chess instructor and the co-owner of Silver Knights Chess Academy in Virginia. Many pros this week called for an end to the constant finger-pointing that seemed to follow players like Naroditsky who thrived in fast-paced play. Kenneth Regan, a chess international master and computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, said the opportunity to cheat has exploded as the cerebral sport has shifted online. There are ways to police the game online, but Regan said they are intrusive. “The rate of cheating online is 100 to 200 times higher than the rate over the board,” Regan said. “From my point of view, there are five to 10 cases per year over the board.” The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik’s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless cheating allegations about “many dozens of players.” At the time, the platform warned of “Kramnik’s escalating attacks” against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some promising young talents. The speedy style of play popularized in chess' digital arena is somewhat reliant on the honor system. Top talents analyze the board so quickly and move with such precision that cheating allegations have become common. Bullet chess is so fast, Regan said, that it's essentially “playing chess entirely with your gut.” Last week, Naroditsky posted a video in his popular Speedrun series on YouTube, telling viewers he was “back, better than ever” after a short “creative break.” His videos, in which he gave tips and discussed strategy, were great tools for chess players of various abilities, said Benjamin Balas, a psychology professor at North Dakota State. “He would tell you ‘This is the kind of mistake you’re going to see at this level,’ and he would make mistakes, too, and talk to you how to manage them,” Balas said. Nakamura and five-time World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen are also using social media to take chess to a wider audience, increasing its popularity around the world. “People, they see Daniel or other streamers and they start to play online chess,” said John Hartmann, editor of Chess Life magazine. “The streaming personalities, they lead people into the chess world.” Carlsen credited Naroditsky for his work in the streaming space, saying he was “such a resource to the chess community.”",

    "text": "An Alabama death row inmate, who insists he is an \"innocent man,\" asked Republican Gov. Kay Ivey to meet with him before the state puts him to death later this week. Anthony Boyd, 53, is scheduled to be executed on Thursday evening by nitrogen gas at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility for capital murder in the 1993 burning death of Gregory Huguley. Boyd, who has maintained his innocence, made the request to meet with the governor in a recorded message played during a news conference hosted by the Execution Intervention Project and his spiritual adviser, Rev. Jeff Hood. \"Before an innocent man is executed, come sit down with me and have a conversation with the guy you deemed one of the worst of the worst,\" Boyd said. ALABAMA INMATE'S EXECUTION STAYED TO DETERMINE IF HE IS COMPETENT ENOUGH TO BE PUT TO DEATH However, Boyd said if Ivey believes he is being deceptive or evasive during their meeting, \"then please carry out the sentence.\" \"If not, then I ask you to stay this execution, to stop this execution, to have my case fully and fairly investigated,\" Boyd said. A spokesman for Ivey, Mike Lewis, said the governor personally reviews each case in which an execution has been scheduled. \"At this point, however, we have not seen any recent court filings disputing Mr. Boyd’s guilt in the horrific, burning-alive murder of Gregory Huguley. Nor have we received a clemency submission to such an effect,\" Lewis said in a statement to The Associated Press. Lewis noted that the governor's review of execution cases does not include one-on-one meetings with inmates, describing Boyd's abnormal request as \"especially unworkable.\" Ivey has only stopped one execution since she took office in 2017. Huguley’s body was found burned on Aug. 1, 1993, in a rural Talladega County ball field. Prosecutors said Boyd was one of four men who kidnapped Huguley the previous day. A witness for the prosecution testified at the trial as part of a plea agreement, saying that Boyd taped Huguley’s feet together before another man poured gasoline on him and lit him on fire. Prosecutors said Huguley was burned alive over a $200 drug debt. Though Boyd’s attorneys contended that he was attending a party when the crime was carried out, a jury voted 10-2 to convict him of capital murder during a kidnapping. They recommended that he be sentenced to death. Boyd is set to die by nitrogen gas, a controversial method Alabama began using last year when convicted killer Kenneth Smith was executed in January 2024. Attorneys for Boyd have called on the federal courts to block the execution to scrutinize the new method, a request a federal judge denied. On Monday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a request by Boyd’s attorneys to stay the execution.

    "title": "Trump border walls use advanced Roman - inspired smart wall technology",
    "text": "Back when President Joe Biden was presiding over essentially open U.S. borders, I argued that contrary to leftist wishes, border walls actually do work. They are not intended to stop everyone coming through, by any means, but to stop illegal people, goods and drugs getting through easily. Now the Department of Homeland Security is using \"smart walls\" that combine high-tech with good old-fashioned tall, strong barriers to prevent illegal entry. The idea is not new, even if the technology is. The ancient Romans had an early version of smart walls. At Hadrian’s Wall in what is now northern England, the Roman empire established a wall to mark their northern frontier, punctuated by forts. Vindolanda is the best preserved large fort, with the layout still visible in stone foundations and a wealth of archeological finds to help us guess what every building was. Starting in the 1970s, archeologists found remarkably well-preserved personal items, due to the ideal conditions of the surrounding soil. There were not just durable coins, metal, glass and stone, but even leather shoes and clothes, as well as a trove of letters written on thin wood that departing troops had failed to burn. We know a lot about how they lived and worked, communicated, and ran their army. TRUMP SENDS MILITARY AFTER THE CARTELS AND IT’S LONG OVERDUE A \"dumb wall\" would be just putting up a barrier and hoping no one could get over, under or around it. The Romans didn’t rely on that. First, though their wall was easy to cross, it created a visible frontier that any northern tribes would be aware of and thus know they were crossing without permission into Roman territory. The occasional head on a spike, evidence of which was found at Vindolanda, was a primitive warning to the illiterate tribes to the north that maybe proceeding further was a bad idea. That’s what today we’d call psychological operations, or \"psy-ops.\" Second, like the U.S. southern border barrier system, the Roman wall in northern Britain also had early models of signals intelligence to better direct resources to areas under threat. Vindolanda was manned by a cohort, about 500 men or a tenth of a legion. The men went on regular foot and horse-back patrol. They were ready to move to wherever a threat presented, warned either by horse-borne messengers or by signal fires lit at high points along the frontier. They received regular correspondence from the other forts, and occasionally from Rome itself, to keep them informed. TRUMP'S BORDER ENFORCEMENT UNLEASHES NEW WEAPON AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION Two thousand years later, the modern U.S. Border Patrol has more men than the Romans did in Britain, but they are still few compared to the land they cover. The Border Patrol is getting some much-needed new manpower and resources, after years of neglect under Biden and former Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, who diverted staff off the line to processing and releasing illegal aliens into the country. But even with the significant boost they are getting in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, they will still be thinly spread along 1,800 miles of southern border and nearly 5,000 in the north. That’s why, like Roman signal fires and messengers, high-tech cameras, sensors, drones and lights on the wall or around the border area can all help detect illegal crossings early, so that the Patrol can send vehicles and officers quickly to intercept them. Under Biden, illegal aliens were so confident of being released that they gladly surrendered to any American in uniform. Millions were released over Biden’s four years. Under President Donald Trump, however, things have completely changed. Encounters of illegal aliens at the border between ports of entry are about a tenth of what they were in the peak Biden months. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION And unlike the Biden years, almost none are being released into the interior to await years of immigration process. Instead, as the law requires, they are mostly being detained throughout any applicable immigration process until the U.S. has determined whether they have a right to remain. This fact alone has discouraged many from even attempting to come illegally. DHS recently announced the award of $4.5 billion in contracts for 230 miles of various types of barriers along the border with Mexico. This includes 80 miles of the barriers in the middle of the Rio Grande along the Texas border, which may include the effective spinning orange buoys that the state installed in the face of Biden administration opposition as part of operation Lone Star in 2023. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The DHS \"smart wall\" means not just 30-foot steel bollard walls, but better roads for Border Patrol vehicles to respond to incursions, as well as lights, cameras and sensors. Smart Walls will be built or enhanced in El Paso and Del Rio Texas, San Diego and El Centro in California, and in Tucson and Yuma, Arizona – site of the Morelos Gap, where I saw hundreds of illegals cross in one night in 2023. The Roman empire knew that walls worked. If well-manned and supported, they could create a stable frontier with limited access according to rules they set. In Trump’s second term, the United States is implementing the same, proven tactics to limit illegal entry to the United States, thus reducing drug smuggling, human trafficking and other crime.",
