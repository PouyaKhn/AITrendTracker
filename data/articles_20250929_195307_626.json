    "title": "Droneforbud får kritik : Vores levebrød bliver lukket ned",
    "text": "Ejer du en drone, må du ikke længere sende den i luften. Transportminister Thomas Danielsen har nemlig indført forbud mod at flyve med droner fra mandag til fredag. Men selvom droneforbuddet sker som konsekvens af den seneste uges dronehændelser og det kommende EU-topmøde, er alle ikke tilfredse med forbuddet. Det skriver DR. For flere arbejdspladser, der gør brug af droner, kan i den kommende uge ikke passe deres opgaver. Det gælder blandt andet WeFly, som både bruger droner til at lave opmålinger på byggepladser og inspektioner af infrastruktur. - Det er jo et ret stort indgreb i vores dagligdag. Det er vores levebrød, der er blevet lukket ned, siger direktør for WeFly, Jan Engsted. Han bakkes op af direktør i Drone Eksperten Victor Thomsen. Virksomheden laver nemlig også droneinspektioner og har grundet forbuddet måttet aflyse flere flyvninger den kommende uge. Bliver ikke let at få dispensation Droneforbuddet blev udmeldt med kort varsel søndag. Og allerede søndag aften kontaktede WeFly Trafikstyrelsen for at finde ud af, om de kan søge dispensation til nogle af deres droneflyvninger. Men det bliver ikke let. For ifølge transportminister Thomas Danielsen gives der kun dispensation til droneflyvninger, hvis der er tale om 'uopsættelige og samfundsvigtige droneoperationer'. Det udtaler han i en pressemeddelelse. Politiet skal nemlig have arbejdsro til EU-topmødet. - Jo færre droner, vi skal forholde os til, desto nemmere er det at håndtere. Og lige i den kommende uge står vi i en helt særlig sikkerhedspolitisk situation, siger Thomas Danielsen til Ritzau. Efterspørger klare rammer Hos Dansk Industri møder droneforbuddet dog opbakning. »I Dansk Industri bakker vi op om og har fuld forståelse for regeringens tiltag i denne konkrete og alvorlige situation,« siger branchedirektør i DI Transport Hakon Iversen til BT. Men han mener, at der på sigt er behov for klare rammer for erhvervslivets brug af droner. I en pressemeddelelse foreslår Dansk Industri et droneluftrum, hvor lovlige civile droner identificerer sig og kan overvåges. På den måde sikrer man ifølge DI, at erhvervslivet kan benytte droner, samtidig med at det bliver klart, hvilke droner der er legitime, og hvilke der ikke er.",

    "text": "Met special constable sacked for gross misconduct A Metropolitan Police special constable who has been found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting a child has been dismissed for gross misconduct. James Bubb, who now identifies as a woman named Gwyn Samuels, groomed one of his two victims online before sexually assaulting her when she was just 12 years old. The 27-year-old, from Chesham in Buckinghamshire, was also found guilty in August of raping a woman he met online while posing as a 16-year-old girl. A misconduct hearing on Friday found that he had breached the standards of professional behaviour at the level of gross misconduct and he was dismissed without notice. Det Ch Supt Simon Stancombe, of the Met Police anti-corruption and abuse command, said after his conviction last month: \"Bubb was immediately suspended as a volunteer police officer [in April 2024] as soon as we became aware of these very serious allegations. \"No complaints had previously been made about Bubb's conduct while performing his duties as a special constable.\" Amersham Law Courts heard the offences took place between 1 January 2018 and 2 April 2024 in London and Buckinghamshire. Bubb met his first victim on the online chat site Omegle in 2018 - before meeting in person for the first time at a Christian festival a few months later. Prosecutors said Bubb was a volunteer steward and the victim was wearing a colour-coded child's wristband that was clearly on show. The officer sexually assaulted the girl in public shortly before her 13th birthday. The special constable started to volunteer with Met Police Central West team in September 2020 and was off-duty when all the incidents took place. Bubb was found guilty of one count of raping a child under 13, one count of sexual activity with a child, one count of assault of a child under 13 by penetration, and one count of assault by penetration - all relating to the same complainant. He was found not guilty of one count of rape and one count of sexual activity with a child in relation to the same complainant. Bubb was found guilty of one count of rape against a second complainant. He is due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 19 December.

    "text": "Baby could have had heart checks, inquest hears A seven-month-old baby who died with an undiagnosed heart condition could have undergone further checks when his symptoms failed to clear up, an inquest has heard. Tommy Kneebone, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, was taken to his GP and to A&E several times by his mother with a cough. He was treated with antibiotics for a suspected respiratory infection, but his cough persisted and he died at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Pembury, on 21 January, 2023. A professor of paediatric medicine told Kent and Medway Coroner's Court earlier that Tommy's continuing symptoms \"could perhaps have triggered further investigations for a possible heart condition\". Juan Kaski, professor of paediatric inherited cardiovascular medicine at Great Ormand Street Hospital (GOSH), told the inquest in Maidstone there \"has to be awareness that heart conditions can present in that way\". A post-mortem examination indicated Tommy had died from cardiomyopathy - a type of heart disease - which was most likely to be genetic. Heart failure Prof Kaski said many cardiomyopathies go undetected as \"symptoms children may present with are non specific\" and in many cases the same as for more common conditions such as respiratory infections. He was asked by coroner Sarah Clarke about Tommy's symptoms of sweating, clamminess, not feeding and signs of dehydration. The coroner asked asked: \"Is that obviously a child that's in heart failure?\" Prof Kaski replied that it was \"difficult to say, but as a cardiologist my bias would be those symptoms would certainly be in keeping with that\". When Tommy was taken to hospital, Prof Kaski said if heart failure had been diagnosed sooner, he could have been taken to a surgery centre which could have stabilised him. However, he added: \"I can't say if that would have prevented him from dying from heart failure.\" The inquest previously heard Shanice Kneebone, Tommy's mother, felt her son was \"not safe\" at the hospital as \"no-one took her concerns seriously\". It also heard Tommy's parents had since undergone tests that did not suggest they passed the condition to their son. The inquest has now finished hearing evidence and the coroner will deliver her findings in the coming weeks. Follow BBC Kent on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "text": "Mother to be charged with murdering three children Three charges of murder have been authorised against a mother accused of killing her young children at their home in Bristol, police have said. Seven-year-old Fares Bash, three-year-old Joury Bash and nine-month-old Mohammed Bash were found dead by officers called to the house in Blaise Walk, Sea Mills on 18 February 2024. The children died as a result of knife wounds to their necks and chests, an inquest was previously told. Yasmeen Ali, 43, is due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court at a date to be confirmed. Ms Ali remains in the care of the mental health services, having been taken to hospital with not life-threatening injuries after the incident. Ch Insp Keith Smith said: \"This has been an extremely complex and highly sensitive investigation, resulting in charges being authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service. \"We know this incident has had a devastating impact on the children's loved ones, those close to the family, as well as the wider Sea Mills community – a community which has shown remarkable resilience and kindness over the past 19 months. \"It's vitally important we allow the court process to continue unhindered and we'd respectfully ask people to refrain from speculation and consider the impact of commentary on those who are continuing to mourn the tragic loss of three children.\" Mr Smith added the neighbourhood policing team will be available to speak to anyone who has worries or concerns as a result of this latest development. Specialist prosecutor Andrew Pritchard, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings.\" Following the deaths, Avon and Somerset Police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over prior contact, but the watchdog said no investigation was required.

    "text": "Up to 1,000 bus drivers to strike after talks fail About 1,000 Greater Manchester Bee Network bus drivers will go ahead with planned strikes after \"talks broke down\" over pay, a union has said. The Unite union said 1,000 drivers from Metroline's Sharston, Hyde Road, Ashton and Wythenshawe depots would take action from Tuesday to Thursday. Transport for Greater Manchester earlier announced strikes planned for the same time by another 1,100 drivers working for Stagecoach and First Bus Rochdale had been suspended. A Metroline spokesperson said: \"We are disappointed that Unite has continued to pursue strike action rather than giving drivers the choice to ballot on our improved offer of an 8.8% increase over two years.\" The firm said the offer was in line with Stagecoach's and said it remained \"open and committed to finding a resolution\". Unite said strike action planned by drivers from the other two companies had been suspended after their employers \"came back to the table with a revised pay offer\". \"Workers at Metroline will continue with industrial action as planned as the employer has not made an offer deemed acceptable to our members,\" the union's regional officer Colin Hayden said. About 2,000 drivers took industrial action last week in their ongoing pay dispute. Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "text": "'Deliveroo' gunman shot girl and dad, court told A gunman disguised as a Deliveroo rider shot an eight-year-old girl and her father during a spree of \"targeted\" attacks, the Old Bailey has heard. Jazz Reid allegedly fired 11 shots, hitting the child twice and her 34-year-old father five times as they sat with other family members in a car in Ladbroke Grove, north-west London, on 24 November 2024. It was one of three linked shootings involving the use of two guns, one of which was recovered from underneath a concrete slab outside 33-year-old Mr Reid's home following his arrest, jurors were told. Mr Reid has denied the attempted murder of the father and wounding the girl with intent. Neither victim can be identified for legal reasons. Each shooting was allegedly planned and executed with \"precision\", and Mr Reid switched his mobile phone and sim card to avoid detection, prosecutor Michael Goodwin KC told jurors. Mr Reid would drive a hire car from his Uxbridge home to an associate's flat in north Kensington, change into his Deliveroo disguise - complete with a takeaway box - and cycle an e-bike to the location of his intended targets, the court heard. In the first shooting on 9 October last year, Mr Reid allegedly fired twice, hitting a man in the thigh at his home in Notting Hill. 'Nowhere to escape' In body-worn video shown to jurors, the victim told police the assailant was carrying a \"kangaroo\" bag, before correcting it to \"Deliveroo\", as he was being treated at the scene. On 11 November, Mr Reid fired four shots at an address in north London linked to the father, who was the subject of the third attack, it was claimed. No injuries were reported to police on that occasion. Thirteen days later, Mr Reid allegedly shot the eight-year-old girl and her father in their car on Southern Row in Ladbroke Grove. Mr Goodwin said: \"They had nowhere to escape to when the defendant opened fire on them. \"Each of these three shootings are alleged to have been targeted shootings. They were planned and executed with precision.\" Mr Goodwin added: \"He was disguised as a Deliveroo driver when he carried out the shootings. All three occasions involved a Deliveroo driver riding an e-bike.\" The court heard that a 9mm self-loading pistol loaded with 17 live rounds was found under a slab of concrete outside Mr Reid's home in Uxbridge. His DNA was found on the grip and muzzle of the pistol, which was forensically linked to the third shooting, jurors were told. A different gun was used in the first two shootings, with the defendant's partial DNA identified on casings at the second scene, the court heard. The defendant's car journeys to north-west London were tracked by police on CCTV, traffic cameras and through cell site data, jurors were told. The e-bike and Deliveroo disguise were later recovered from a flat on the Swinbrook Estate. Mr Reid pleaded not guilty to wounding with intent on 9 October 2024 and a string of firearms offences relating to the incidents. The Old Bailey trial continues.

    "text": "Airplane maintenance workers at a North Carolina airport found the body of a suspected stowaway in the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight that had recently arrived from Europe, police said. The body was found on Sunday morning while the plane was undergoing maintenance at Charlotte Douglas international airport. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department said in a statement that it is investigating the death. Neither the airline nor police have offered information about the person who died, including a possible cause of death, or said where the flight originated. The airport said it was deeply saddened by the discovery and that it will support the police investigation. American Airlines said it was working with law enforcement on its investigation and directed questions to police. Experts believe roughly three-quarters of stowaways do not survive if they hide on a plane’s undercarriage because of the extreme cold and lack of oxygen they experience as the plane reaches cruising altitude. In January, two bodies were found in the landing gear compartment of a JetBlue aircraft at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood international airport. The bodies were discovered in the wheel well area during a routine post-flight inspection. The aircraft had arrived in Fort Lauderdale shortly after flight from John F Kennedy international airport in New York. The jet had been in both Kingston, Jamaica, and Salt Lake City, Utah, earlier that day. In December, a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane after it landed in Maui from Chicago.",

    "title": "John Oliver on Netanyahu :  Personally responsible for keeping this war going  | John Oliver",
    "text": "John Oliver targeted Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a fiery episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight. The host joked that Netanyahu was the “original source material for Mr Potato Head” as well as being the leader of the country on and off since 1996, making him their longest serving prime minister. He has repeatedly claimed he is “the only person capable of keeping Israel safe” and has tried to market himself as “a big strong guy who won’t let Israel get pushed around”. But Oliver said he has also been in charge of the “longest and deadliest war in Israel’s history” and one that is “not currently that popular in Israel” with polls showing he would lose an election if held today. He said that Netanyahu is “a man so singularly focused on remaining in power, he’s allied with the most extreme voices in his country”. He then detailed a brief history, explaining his formative years in the US before he went into international diplomacy back home and then politics. Oliver said he publicly “went scorched Earth” on rival Yitzhak Rabin who was then assassinated, something his wife blamed on Netanyahu on television. He has long promised that he can bring the US along with whatever he does, claiming that America can be easily pushed. “Even if that is true, it’s insulting to hear out loud,” he said. During Donald Trump’s first term, Netanyahu had him help push the Abraham Accords which would freeze the Palestinians out. “Of course it was a fuck you to the Palestinians,” Oliver said, joking that if Netanyahu “could pour a bowl of cereal in a way that would meaningfully make conditions in Gaza worse, he would do that”. His career has been increasingly “defined by attempts to cling to power” despite allegations of corruption, bribery and fraud. Oliver also spoke about his wife, Sara, known as “Israel’s Marie Antoinette” for her indulgent lifestyle and alleged abusive behaviour toward household staff. He said that the “drumbeat of scandals led more centrist parties in Israel to decide they wouldn’t form a coalition with him” so he had to go further to the right with extreme voices. One of them is Itamar Ben Gvir, who has been referred to as “the David Duke of Israel”, which Oliver said is “like calling someone the JK Rowling of trans people”. Another is Bezalel Smotrich, a proud homophobe and “willful provocateur” who has said there’s no such thing as the Palestinian people. He called them both “absolute nightmares central to Netanyahu’s coalition” and that the prime minister is “committed to delivering for his extremist partners”. Oliver then got to what happened on 7 October with the Hamas attack. “No one would say Netanyahu personally caused 7 October but he has definitely ensured that what’s come after has caused exponentially more suffering that might otherwise have been the case,” he said. He spoke about how Netanyahu had strategically tried to keep Hamas in power so he could more easily target a divided Palestinian government and has blown off a warning from Israel’s security chief about an attack. What has happened since has been termed a genocide by major organisations and the international criminal court has issued arrest warrants charging Netanyahu and his circle with war crimes. Oliver said Netanyahu is “personally responsible for keeping this war going” after breaking a ceasefire in March and caving to far-right ministers. Oliver said it’s “impossible to overstate the death and suffering Netanyahu’s decisions have caused” reminding his audience that over 65,000 Palestinians have been killed. Oliver added that what is happening is “all truly horrifying” and also referenced Israel’s attack on Iran, a decision that even annoyed Trump. Netanyahu then went on Fox News to nominate the US president for a Nobel peace prize. Oliver said it is “very clear that Netanyahu is desperate to stay in power and will do whatever it takes”. His popularity has been waning with many Israelis “understandably furious” and only 21% of Americans supporting him. “I think people have seen a little too much at this point,” Oliver said. Oliver added: “Israelis removing this fucking guy from power might at the very least bring a stop to the horrific suffering in Gaza and bring the hostages home.”",

    "title": "Mixed feelings on Labour plan for mandatory digital ID | Identity cards",
    "text": "The proposal for compulsory digital ID cards strikes at the heart of what it means to be British (Starmer to unveil digital ID cards in plan set to ignite civil liberties row, 25 September). Our unwritten constitution rests on the hard-won principle that we are citizens, not subjects of the government. Free people who are not required to carry papers at the demand of authority – an authority that is our servant, not our master. At present, the state may ask us for identification, but it cannot compel us. That distinction is not a quibble of law but a line in the sand – it defines the relationship between people and power. Britain has long stood apart from continental traditions of state surveillance. The freedom to go about one’s business without having to show papers has always been more than a convenience; it is a quiet assertion of dignity, liberty and trust in the people. To surrender that would not be a mere technical change, but a constitutional rupture. We should resist it with all the clarity and passion such a betrayal deserves. Dorian Kelly Colchester, Essex Your report says “Tony Blair’s plans for ID cards were abandoned in the 2000s” – this is not quite right. The Identity Cards Act received royal assent in 2006. Steps were then taken to implement it, including issuing cards (I used mine instead of a passport on various occasions). Jacqui Smith, the then home secretary, announced in 2008 that by 2014-15, 90% of all foreign nationals in the country would have been issued with a card. However, the first act of Theresa May when she became home secretary in 2010 was to repeal the legislation, abandon ID cards and set up a photocall to physically destroy the hard disk containing the data on the national identity register. Her decision severely weakened this country’s capacity to control immigration, with the disastrous consequences we see today. I am delighted that this government is intending to re-establishing a modernised digital system. Charles Clarke Home secretary, 2004-06 As a retired director of IT, I find myself screaming when I hear politicians misrepresent how a digital ID would work. It is clear that they have only a rudimentary grasp of IT when they talk about “carrying a digital ID on your smartphone”. This is not how the system would work. What is proposed is for anyone with the right to live and work in the UK to have their biometric details (typically, photograph and fingerprints) held on a government database. This already happens in many cases (eg when applying for a passport or a work visa). As well as the risks of holding such data centrally, there is the issue of how the data will be accessed. Yes, you might be able to carry a copy on a smartphone, but how secure is your phone? A lot of people sacrifice security for convenience. Yes, an employer might need to access the database, but how will that be controlled? This is a can of worms and I wish politicians could explain it accurately. John Robinson Deal, Kent Why does Keir Starmer not mention the most important advantage of ID cards, that they make it easier and simpler to vote? The framing of the issue in terms of controlling immigration rather than strengthening democracy speaks volumes about how far his government has abandoned the last vestiges of socialism. Even when it does the right thing, it is for the wrong reasons. Andrew Halliday Bremen, Germany Here in France, where I’ve lived since 1997, ID cards are a major convenience. They’re invaluable when registering a car, dealing with banks, applying for loans, entering hospital and many other everyday situations. Over the border in Spain, hotel receptionists ask for them during check-in. Nobody here understands the paranoia in a Britain. But our ID cards are physical. If I was Keir Starmer, I’d introduce paper ones and forget digital. Martin Castellan Léran, Ariège, France I doubt unscrupulous employers hiring illegal migrants, or the migrants themselves, are going to be deterred by a national identity card that seeks to stop both parties from breaking the law. They already know they’re doing that. It’s called the “shadow economy” for a reason. Mike Galvin Winchcombe, Gloucestershire I assume those whose opposition to a digital ID is based on the threat posed by having their data stored on a central computer system will no longer be visiting EU countries once they are forced to provide fingerprints and a photograph to travel to those countries (Will the EU’s new fingerprint entry system cause gridlock? The Guardian tried it out, 27 September). Mike Lowcock Sandbach, Cheshire Why the fuss about ID cards? I still have my national registration identity card, issued in 1943 and signed by my father. I treasure it. Helen Evans Ruthin, Denbighshire",

    "title": "Tensions expected as Trump meets with top Democrats and Republicans in effort to avoid shutdown",
    "text": "Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for a crunch White House meeting with Donald Trump in an 11th-hour bid to avert a potentially damaging federal government shutdown. Monday’s gathering is aimed at reaching an agreement over funding the government and largely hinges on Democrat demands for an extension of funding subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, beyond the end of the year, when they are due to expire. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives, and Chuck Schumer, the party’s leader in the Senate, will meet Trump along with their Republican counterparts, Mike Johnson, the House speaker, and John Thune, the Senate majority leader, for talks that are expected to be tense if not confrontational. It will be Trump’s first meeting with the two Democrats since his return to the White House in January. Jeffries and Trump have never previously met in person. Expectations for the encounter are low, with failure likely to result in large swathes of the federal government shutting down from 1 October. Trump and the Republicans have signaled that they are unfazed at that prospect, calculating that the public will blame Democrat intransigence. The White House office of management and budget (OMB) has also indicated that it will exploit a shutdown to carry out more mass firings as part of its crusade to slash government bureaucracy. An OMB memorandum said government agencies have been instructed “use this opportunity to consider reduction in force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities”, The Hill reported. Republicans have also warned that Trump could make a shutdown politically costly by targeting spending programmes that are disproportionately used by Democrat-run states and cities. CBS, citing a source close to Trump, reported that he privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it would “enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries”. “I just don’t know how we are going to solve this issue,” Trump told the network in a telephone interview. “They [the Democrats] are not interested in waste, fraud and abuse.” Some Democrats have acknowledged that they have “no good options” in trying to end the standoff. “It’s doubly made no good because it’s very clear that Republicans want [a shutdown]. Trump wants it. He’s fine with that, happy to have it,” The Hill quoted a Democratic Senate aide as saying.. “I don’t really know what your good option here is when they want one.” However, Schumer is under pressure to be seen taking a more actively confrontational stance after being fiercely criticized by fellow Democrats for backing a Republican funding packing in March to avert an earlier government shutdown. With Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican senator, likely to vote against the funding package, it would need the support of eight Democrats to overcome a Senate filibuster.",

    "title": "Melissa Leong :  Life is not easy . Life is ugly and hard and unpredictable  | Australian lifestyle",
    "text": "At home in Melbourne’s Carlton North, Melissa Leong is feeling apprehensive. She’s preparing to spend the day talking about her new memoir, Guts, which reveals personal struggles she has never before spoken about publicly. “This part – laying yourself bare, so to speak, multiple times a day – is challenging,” she says. “It’s mentally challenging. It’s emotionally challenging.” The former MasterChef judge and Dessert Masters host describes herself as an introvert, a private person who likes to retreat and recover after a day on set. In her memoir, Leong has found a way to balance that need for privacy with being vulnerable. She shares her battles with depression and anxiety, bouts of loneliness while filming MasterChef, and her experiences of bulimia, self-harm and sexual violence. A running thread is Leong’s propensity for “blowing up” her life. She writes about leaving a secure job to live on a sheep dairy in Tasmania, and her divorce. “I have become a bit of an expert at it,” she writes, though she’s wary of encouraging others to do the same. “If you are going to push the big red button, you do need to be prepared for some fallout, because it’s inherently a selfish thing,” Leong says. “And when I say selfish, I don’t mean selfish in a bad way. “There are certain things we have come to realise, as women, that we can do and have for ourselves and our friends that don’t involve subscribing to societal norms.” Leong says she shut herself away to write about what felt true to her, including her childhood in the predominantly white suburb of Cronulla, Sydney, in the 80s; how chronic pain halted a promising musical career (she started playing the piano aged three); her work as a makeup artist; quitting her first corporate job and breaking into the – surprisingly hostile at the time – world of food writing. “There’s a little sweetness in running your own race, emerging triumphant, and realising that everybody who didn’t believe you could do it is just way back there,” Leong says. “I’ve met a lot of people that have tried to set me back and that’s OK because resistance gives you something tangible to push against.” The 43-year-old called her book Guts because she wanted the title to express visceral discomfort. “Life is not easy. Life is ugly and hard and unpredictable, and often less than ideal, and I liked that in one syllable you have this word that is loaded.” She’s buoyed up by others in the industry who have written memoirs, including Kumi Taguchi, whom she met during her time at SBS as a judge on The Chef’s Line, which she calls “MasterChef with training wheels”. She feels she’s in good company alongside women telling complex stories. “Having people like Kumi on my side and in my corner have helped galvanise me.” Leong writes that she has come to accept she was raped approximately 15 years ago. She doesn’t name the perpetrator but she hopes that sharing her story might help others. “The particular configuration of experiences I’ve had are mine but these are things that have happened to our friends, sisters, mothers, cousins. “I share these things because I know that they’re not unique to me, and so if I can articulate them in a way that maybe someone else can’t articulate yet to themselves, if that means they feel less alone, then that’s a success to me.” Now Leong is unapologetic about prioritising herself, “because for the majority of my life I have been a people-pleaser”. “I have wanted to make other people around me happy to the detriment of my health, my wealth and myself, really.” She jokes about not knowing if it’s age or perimenopause, but “if one of the side-effects is that I give less fucks, then I don’t care”. Leong endured criticism from the moment she was announced as the first female MasterChef judge in 2020. In the aftermath of her cohost Jock Zonfrillo’s death in 2023, she was further criticised for choosing to grieve privately. In Guts, Leong describes MasterChef as “a set of golden handcuffs” – at once a tremendous opportunity and also limiting. “I’m really proud of the time I put in; I learned a lot, I grew a lot, but I also just as equally wanted to continue moving, so that the expectations people had for me weren’t able to atrophy around me.” After hosting two seasons of Dessert Masters, Leong took an unexpected pivot to hosting UFC Fight Week. “It was as far in the opposite direction as I could imagine,” she says. She’s a huge fan of mixed martial arts and is about 18 months into jiujitsu training, working towards a third stripe on her white belt. “It’s the right combination of human instinct and critical thinking. Plus, it’s a great workout. If you’re stressed, getting really sweaty and exhausted a couple of times a week is quite good, for me anyway.” Leong has also finished filming a new show in New Zealand called Taste of Art, with the Amisfield executive chef, Vaughan Mabee. Though the show is “back in the world of food – and studios and dresses and fine dining,” she hopes viewers will see an evolution in her career. She’s also on screens now as a contestant in The Amazing Race Australia: Celebrity Edition, swapping designer dresses and heels for tie-dye T-shirts and trainers. It’s been “quite freeing” to relinquish control and be at the whim of reality TV’s gameplan, she says. “Being able to just trust was a wonderful exercise for me. I am a big subscriber to: just sign on to every experience life offers you. “I think we learn a lot about ourselves through being uncomfortable. And not all of those lessons are soft, fluffy, kind, nice things but they’re nevertheless incredibly valuable.” This philosophy helped with sharing the darker parts of her life in Guts. Any doubts were “overshadowed by the truth”, she says. “If I’m going to tell my story then I’m going to tell my story. I can’t sugar-coat the less-than-ideal things that have happened to me. “These are things that have very much shaped me in the choices I’ve made in my life. The last few years have been a lot about survival and not much else, if I’m honest. But I sit here now really proud of what I’ve been able to accomplish.” - Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

    "title": "  Were 17 all over again : the nostalgic glory of a road trip with old friends | A Drive Like No Other",
    "text": "In a series to celebrate XPENG’s partnership with new movie A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, four writers share memories of the journeys that made them who they are. There’s always an air of nostalgia to a road trip. That feeling of throwing your bags into the boot, piling into the car with friends and hitting the open road, not caring if you’re going to a beach an hour away or on a drive that’ll take the whole day. The destination doesn’t matter – the journey always feels like a familiar adventure. The smallest sensation can unlock a memory, too. Your friend’s arm pressing against yours in the middle seat. The stereo cranking out the opening bars of a song you loved in 2003, or that sense of satisfaction that comes from perfectly packing everyone’s bags into the boot like Tetris. Those feelings of deja vu that wash over you whenever you get a familiar scent, or sight, or sound. The moment I climb into a car with my oldest friends, I feel exactly as I did when I was 17. Each school holiday was an opportunity to set off on long drives down to Bude, where we’d pitch our tents poorly, try our hand at surfing and say yes to all the unexpected pitstops our parents would have refused, such as trips to a roadside gnome museum or the ice-cream van parked in a layby. Those trips were our first taste of freedom, a sneak peek into the adult years that were right on the horizon. Looking back, it was so sudden – that leap from adolescence to adulthood, but at the time it felt like we’d been waiting for it forever. Nowadays, I take similar trips with those same friends and I feel like we’re 17 all over again. Even when their kids are now sitting in the back of the car, singing along to Catatonia and Bowling for Soup, just as we did 20 years ago. When I see a roadside stall selling fresh strawberries, or a cute little coffee shop I want to stop at, I still look around for a grownup to ask, before realising that we’re the adults now. Our road trips have been upgraded a little since those early years, though. The days of paper maps, boiling hot cars and noisy engines have been replaced with satnav, air con and blissfully silent drives. But even though the technology has been modernised, even though we’re now kept cool and heading in the right direction, that feeling remains the same. I still feel as if we’re setting off on an epic adventure, even if it’s to the same stretch of sea we’ve visited dozens of times. Because although we’ve grown older, and the backseat is now filled with kids that we’re somehow responsible for, the beach has stayed the same, the route feels just like it did, and those ties are as strong as ever. We still pile out of the car, the twigs snapping underfoot as we figure out the best place to pitch our tents. And even though we’ve upgraded our cars and our camping rigouts (now complete with memory foam sleeping mats and blackout eye masks), the morning light still looks as it did all those years ago, as it filters through the canvas at dawn. We still gather bedraggled by the kettle on the camping stove, only now with a few more lines on our faces and kids running around our feet. We spend the morning chatting – enamel mugs filled with coffee (the good stuff) – and plan how we’ll spend the day, pumping up the paddleboards that I’m pretty sure didn’t exist in 2003, as we work out which beach or lake we’ll explore that day. If anything, we’re more adventurous now, eager to spend the whole day on the water, packing dry bags with sandwiches and water bottles, hoping the sun will keep on shining. If I’m lucky, I’ll hop on a board with one of the older kids who’ll do all the paddling, so I can sit on the back and watch the sea as we move over the ripples, thinking about the chats I used to have with their mothers when we were the very same age.

    "text": "I wish to add my support to those wanting to reinstate Angie Thomas’s The Hate U Give to the reading list of Budmouth Academy (Dorset school urged to reinstate banned book about race to reading list, theguardian.com, 26 September). As both an alumna of the school and a professor of English literature, I am deeply concerned about this act. The rationale for the ban for year 10 – that the novel teaches children that “skin colour” makes them “baddies” – is simply not supported by the novel. At its centre is a relationship between young people from different ethnic backgrounds learning about racial difference from each other. The suggestion that “by extension” the novel leads Britain itself to be cast as “a baddie” is deeply worrying. It suggests a notion of Britishness that excludes non-white people but does include Americans – perhaps recalling our own migrant and colonial history. There is an irony there that those supporting the ban may wish to ponder. Finally, as a first-generation academic who learned the importance of literature in that very library, I am keen that we widen rather than narrow the opportunities for reading. Progression into higher education is lower in south-west coastal communities than elsewhere in the country. Budmouth students should be encouraged to read and expand their knowledge of the world – especially when it doesn’t coincide with their own worldviews. This novel has been powerful in encouraging children to come back to reading and should be celebrated for that. The ban is crude dog-whistle politics and Weymouth’s young adults deserve more.

    "title": "  It should be gay Disneyland : the struggle to revitalise Sydney Oxford Street without selling its soul | Sydney",
    "text": "Zink & Sons has made bespoke suits on Sydney’s Oxford Street for 130 years. For most of that time, the family-owned men’s tailoring business has resided at number 56, halfway between Hyde Park and the street’s LGBTQI heart at Taylor Square. Today its director, Daniel Jones, is looking for a new base after a rent increase he says is unaffordable. His shop is located in a development project that has been almost six years in the making. Oxford and Foley, a commercial strip of renovated heritage buildings, has been touted as key to revitalising the storied and colourful street, bringing new retail, hospitality and creative spaces, upmarket tenants and an injection of fresh energy. Three weeks ago, Golf Wang, the much-hyped fashion store of the musician Tyler, The Creator, was the first shop to open in the refurbished section of the commercial strip. But the development has casualties, with its hoardings dominating the street for years and decimating foot traffic, according to one local operator. Then came construction of the City of Sydney’s $18.5m bike path running from Hyde Park to Taylor Square, further putting off customers. A block away from Zink & Sons, Terry Daly is celebrating 40 years at the helm of Daly Male, a sequin-filled menswear store and stalwart of the gay scene. Despite regular customers and massive sales each Mardi Gras, he has asked for a rent reduction for the first time in four decades. Daly says “no one” wanted the bike path. “We’re watching it daily and looking at how empty it is.” Stretching from the city to Bondi Junction, Oxford Street has long weathered change, but some locals are concerned high prices and the influx of international brands will change the character of their neighbourhood for the worse. “The new shops will be good for business eventually – but we don’t need Louis Vuitton, we want little designers, we want independents,” Daly says. A series of setbacks Stephan Gyory from the Darlinghurst Business Partnership says the street’s western strip has seen disruption after disruption in recent decades, beginning with 2005 road upgrades, then the arrival of two Westfield malls close to each end, one in Pitt Street and one in Bondi Junction. In 2014, lockout laws delivered a blow to its colourful nightlife. Then came Covid and the cost-of-living doldrums. AsheMorgan in partnership with The Toga Group leased the strip from the City of Sydney in 2019 on a 99-year basis. Approved in May 2022, the $200m project has overshot initial timeline forecasts by two years with the first fully restored block due to open by November and the final block next June. Among its challenges were the pandemic, a review into development control plans, and a change of builder that led to legal action.. Today, though, Gyory is cautiously positive. “There’s a palpable sense that it’s turned. It’s cool,” he says. “It feels like something is happening – but people have less money, so they’re spending it more carefully.” There are also fewer shoppers, says Ken Holmes. The owner operator of 41-year-old men’s swimwear purveyor Aussie Boys says he vacated at short notice to new premises in April 2020 after the City of Sydney leased his old building to Oxford and Foley. It took more than two years for any work to begin, he says. He once sold $999,900 worth of swimwear and underwear in Mardi Gras season. For three days last week, he did not make a single sale. City of Sydney council minutes indicate Oxford and Foley was originally slated to be completed by 2023, and Holmes says he understood it would definitely be open by the time Sydney hosted World Pride in February of that year. “In the last six months, it’s probably been the worst it’s ever been,” he says. “It’s not that I don’t have the stock – I don’t have the customers. This should be gay Disneyland but the City of Sydney has killed it.” AsheMorgan, the leaseholder and investment company behind the project, says Oxford and Foley “is set to become a flagship of urban renewal with a bold vision for adaptive reuse – honouring the past while shaping a lively, creative future for Sydney”. Among the tenants preparing to move in are Sony Australia, the luxury cycling brand MAAP, late-night eatery Big Poppa’s, gelato bar Mapo, Mecca Coffee and Paulie’s Pizzas. AsheMorgan says Jones’s claims about an unaffordable rent rise are “completely incorrect”. Bike path disputes Further up the street towards Paddington, a tired, once-thriving strip now sports a row of empty, graffitied shop fronts. Jim’s Butchery, which operated nearby for almost 100 years, closed its doors this month. The Bookshop Darlinghurst, an independent queer bookshop operating since 1982, announced at the weekend it would close at Christmas because repeated delays for the full opening of Oxford and Foley had postponed its planned move to larger premises in the new development, imposing unsustainable costs. But there is a more hopeful sign in the arrival of a new 109-room hotel, due to open on 9 October on the former site of the Grand Pacific Blue Room nightclub and Academy Twin Cinemas, which has sat empty for a decade. “I’m excited,” says Simon Fowler, owner of Simon Says Juice, across the road from the hotel. “It’s nice for someone to see potential in the area and invest in it. It could be the first domino, leading to much bigger things. “What’s been discouraging is a lack of interest to fill empty spaces. It’s not an attractive option to do so because rent is astronomical.” Fowler’s rent is almost $90,000 a year, an amount that has doubled in six years, he says. He believes some shops lie empty because owners can claim a tax write-off against untenanted property losses. On this section of the street the cycleway is a hot topic. It’s early days for traffic on the Darlinghurst section, which opened in July. Clover Moore, lord mayor of the City of Sydney, says she expects businesses will start seeing the benefits, “because more people walking and riding along a calmer street will encourage visits and money spent with those hard-working owners along Oxford Street”. But the middle section of the cycleway, connecting Taylor Square with Centennial Park, remains to be built. Peter McLean from Bicycle NSW says the missing section is a “gaping gap” in the east-west corridor. The path’s eventual completion is a question of when, not if, he says. Fowler hopes the next section of the bike path will run along his cafe front, bringing with it a buffer from buses and possible alfresco dining. “It’ll be a positive to my business I can’t quantify – but it’s going to cost a bunch and people will fight it the whole way,” he says. One of those is the former City of Sydney councillor Kathryn Greiner. She is one of three Paddington locals who is taking the City of Sydney and Transport for NSW on in federal court over the path’s “floating” bus stops – on islands between the bike path and bus lane. Greiner claims they contravene the Disability Discrimination Act’s design guidelines and public transport standards, given the speed of cyclists and how pedestrians need to cross their path at zebra crossings. “Our argument is against the design, which does not give equity of access to people who are ageing, or have a visual impairment, or who are deaf,” she says. “It’s a nice idea, but it’s not well thought-out.” A Transport for NSW spokesperson said the department was developing a design that “balances the needs of all users” and that no decision had been made about the future of the project. Preserving a diverse soul Beyond the bike path, Greiner says the Paddington part of the street is “just starting to come back” after a tough decade or so, while Paddington town hall is to be revamped, with community consultation now open. Moore acknowledges the “significant challenges” the street has faced in the recent past, but says the “stars are really aligning to see Oxford Street reach its full potential” with investment guided by the council’s Australian-first LGBTIQA+ Social and Cultural Place Strategy. “There’s no silver bullet to ensuring our high streets thrive in the face of changing consumer behaviour and demographics, but the City does all it can to protect and enhance these important commercial spines. Oxford Street’s success depends on all of us, from state and local government through to community groups, businesses and landlords,” she says. “We love Oxford Street. It’s one of our greatest and most-loved streets and we’re committed to building on its reputation as an iconic LGBTIQA+ and creative precinct, buzzing with activity day and night.” Despite the obvious positives of the street’s revitalisation, Gyory still worries about the area’s diverse soul. “The more pragmatic people are saying if richer queer people want to come here, that’s good, but we also don’t want them to displace the people who are here,” he says. Marc Kuzma – AKA drag queen Claire de Lune – will serve his last souffle to a dinner and cabaret audience on New Year’s Eve at Claire’s Kitchen. Last week, the owner of the restaurant at number 35 Oxford Street announced the venue would close after 14 years and 950 dinner shows. The entire block, which includes the heritage-listed site of NSW MP Alex Greenwich’s HQ, is to be redeveloped. In a sense, the timing is good, Kuzma says. “It has been a dreadful, dreadful winter. Since we opened I don’t think we had a worse time than this winter,” he says, noting the wet weather and reduced spending habits of even his most faithful clientele. “Oxford Street has lost a little bit of shine because of the development across the road and the bike path took a long time, too, but now that it’s open, it’s quite pleasant. “You cannot always blame the street. You need to make your own luck and we had 14 wonderful years.”",

    "title": "Australia Future Fund discloses huge profits from weapons manufacturers despite fierce criticisms of support for industry | Australian politics",
    "text": "Australia’s $250bn sovereign wealth fund has secured huge returns on investment in weapons and defence companies in less than two years, despite long-running criticism of its support for the industry. The value of shares held in eight companies increased by $76m between October 2023 and June 2025 amid wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and the sharpest increase in military spending since the cold war. The fund’s investments in Israel’s largest private defence contractor, Elbit, which is a major supplier to the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), increased from $489,000 to $2.69m as of 30 June, according to the fund’s latest disclosures. Elbit Systems describes itself as the “backbone” of the IDF’s drone fleet, which has been used extensively in the assault on Gaza. Its portfolio also includes systems for command and control, military aircraft and helicopters, armed remote control boats, and land vehicles. The value of the fund’s holdings in Lockheed Martin, a US headquartered company that produces the F-35 joint strike fighter, increased by 23% from $71m to $88m. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The company’s fighter jets have been bought by Israel and used in the conflict in Gaza. The contribution of more than 75 Australian companies to the global F-35 supply chain has led to calls for the Albanese government to pause exports. A list of 30 “defence companies” the fund invested in, as of October 2023, included Thales, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, Rheinmetall, Boeing and Rolls-Royce. The value of the Future Fund’s shares in Rolls-Royce, which is a defence contractor and the supplier of the propulsion system for the Aukus submarine partnership in addition to civil technology, increased by 268% from $2m to $5.5m. The company’s share price has surged thanks to increased demand for civil engines since the pandemic, in addition to rising defence procurement. Boeing has experienced similar demand for civilian projects. The Future Fund maintains a list of companies it is excluded from investing in. This list includes 11 companies that are blacklisted in accordance with “weapons-related conventions or treaties ratified by Australia”. Among this list is the Italian company Leonardo SpA, which has been excluded from several major funds due to its “involvement in the production of nuclear weapons”. In October 2023, the Future Fund had shares worth $563,739.88 with the company. Greens senator David Shoebridge, who obtained the October 2023 list through a freedom of information application, criticised the Future Fund’s investment in Elbit given the Israeli military’s conduct in Gaza. “Public pressure saw the Future Fund stop investing in tobacco so we know they can set ethical standards if pushed,” Shoebridge said. “They are just choosing not to. “There needs to be a fresh ethical approach to public investment that draws a firm red line across investing in the global harm industry.” Lara Khider, the acting executive director of the Australian Centre for International Justice, called on the Future Fund to reconsider its investments. She cited the international court of justice’s advisory opinion that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories violated international law and amounted to apartheid. “When public funds such as those managed by the Future Fund are invested in companies credibly linked to serious human rights violations or international crimes in Gaza, Austraila risks breaching its international obligations,” Khider said. A Future Fund spokesperson said the fund invested “through external managers and our exposure to publicly listed defence companies is guided by investment indices that are widely used by investors in Australia and around the world”. “Our portfolio exclusions for defence companies are based on controversial weapons-related conventions or treaties ratified by Australia and apply to cluster munitions, anti-personnel mines, chemical or biological weapons and some nuclear weapons,” they said. The Future Fund reached $250bn in value for the first time last financial year after reporting a 12.1% return, which was twice its target. Its main fund pays for the superannuation liabilities of public servants, but it also manages a number of other, smaller pots of money. That includes the Housing Australia Future Fund, which grew to $10.9bn as at mid-2025. Jim Chalmers late last year changed the fund’s investment mandate to force it to “consider Australia’s national priorities”, including boosting housing supply, getting more infrastructure built, and supporting the net zero transformation.

    "title": "Labour to bring back maintenance grants for students on  priority  courses | Universities",
    "text": "Labour is to bring back maintenance grants for tens of thousands of students from low-income backgrounds who sign up to “priority” courses that support the government’s industrial strategy. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the means-tested grants were aimed at “those who need them most” and would be funded by a new international student levy, as outlined in a recent immigration white paper. Making the announcement at the Labour party conference, Phillipson said: “The Tories treated our universities as a political battleground, not a public good. Labour is putting them back in the service of working-class young people.” Students’ time at college or university should be spent learning or training, “not working every hour God sends”, she told delegates. The reintroduction of maintenance grants, which were scrapped in 2016 and replaced by maintenance loans, was welcomed by many in the sector, though there were calls for them to be extended to a wider range of courses. There are also concerns among vice-chancellors about the proposed 6% international student levy that will pay for the grants. Recent research suggested the levy could cost universities in England more than £600m a year. The government said the maintenance grants would be available to students in levels four to six, studying priority courses including university degrees and technical qualifications. Further details will be set out in the autumn statement. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “Treating international students as cash cows to fund maintenance grants amounts to robbing Peter to pay Paul. Instead of attacking foreign students, the Labour government should be fixing our colleges and universities through huge public investment.” Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, the voice of the higher education sector, was also critical of how the move would be funded: “Extra money to support students from diverse backgrounds to study courses critical to economic growth is the right idea – but this would be executing it in the wrong way. “A levy on international students will not help disadvantaged students, it will hinder them. As emerging evidence already shows, it would reduce the number of places available for domestic students and mean universities have even less of their scant resource to invest into expanding access and supporting students.” Nick Harrison, CEO of the Sutton Trust, said it was a positive step in breaking down barriers to opportunity for students from the poorest backgrounds. “They have long been faced with the greatest debt burden, and have been hit hard by the rising cost of living, having to work excessive hours to make ends meet. “The reintroduction of maintenance grants for these students on selected courses is a step in the right direction in equalising access to higher education.” Dani Payne, head of education and social mobility at the Social Market Foundation thinktank, said: “Many students are struggling with the cost of living, and ensuring those from lower income families, with less family support, can afford to study both at university and for technical qualifications is a vital step for social mobility.”",

    "title": "Danny Thompson obituary",
    "text": "Afounder member of the British folk-rock band Pentangle, the double bass player Danny Thompson also added depth and resonance to recordings by artists as varied as Nick Drake and Kate Bush, Cliff Richard and Everything But the Girl, Graham Coxon and John Martyn – to name a handful among the hundreds of sessions he played on from the early 1960s into the 21st century. Thompson, who has died aged 86, was a musician’s musician, his bass always compl. His fluid playing enriched the albums Five Leaves Left (1969) by Drake and Solid Air (1973) by Martyn, and he went on to form a long working relationship with Martyn, and, later, the singer-songwriter Richard Thompson (no relation). It was Lonnie Donegan’s hits of the mid-50s that first inspired Thompson as a young teenager to build a tea-chest bass and join a skiffle band. Working Soho clubs and US airbases in the 60s, he built a name as a capable bassist, and in 1964 he joined Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated. As a band leader, Korner brought together a wealth of young British talent, including Ginger Baker, Charlie Watts, Eric Clapton and Brian Jones, and his stewardship led to Thompson engaging with many rising stars at Korner’s Marquee club base. He became the bassist of choice of jazz musicians such as John McLaughlin and Tubby Hayes, and folk artists such as Davey Graham. In 1967, he and the drummer Terry Cox, also from Blues Incorporated, joined the guitarists Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, and vocalist Jacqui McShee, to complete the lineup of Pentangle. While initially branded a “folk” band, Pentangle employed jazz and classical elements as they reimagined traditional songs, with Thompson playing an important part in that experimentation. The various members having established their names in the Soho folk and rock scene, the band’s first public concert, at the Royal Festival Hall in 1967, was a huge success, as was their debut album, The Pentangle, released the following year. Their 1969 album, Basket of Light, was even bigger commercially, containing the hit single Light Flight, used as the theme for a BBC TV drama, Take Three Girls. It was not the first theme tune for Thompson, who, having realised that recording sessions were more financially rewarding than playing live – “all the money I used to earn on jazz gigs used to get blown before I got home” – had in 1964 played on the recording for the theme music of the TV series Thunderbirds. After Pentangle split in 1972, Thompson chose not to join another group, but to concentrate on playing sessions – the record producer Joe Boyd having already paired him with Drake for Five Leaves Left, did the same with Martyn and Solid Air. Thompson and Martyn were kindred spirits, heavy drinkers who delighted in displays of disruptive, drunken behaviour while touring. Alcoholism would affect both men and led to a notable drop-off in session work for Thompson. However, in the late 70s, Thompson sobered up, and the reverence his recordings with Drake and Martyn were now held in eventually found him again in demand as a session player: in the mid-80s David Sylvian, Bush, Talk Talk, The The, Everything But the Girl, Coxon and Skin all employed him for his lyrical playing. In 1987 Thompson released his debut solo album, Whatever, leading a jazz trio playing the muscular fusion he loved. He released five more low-key solo jazz albums over the next quarter century, alongside continuing to work prodigiously with others, most notably Richard Thompson, the two veterans of the 60s folk scene recording 14 albums together. Last year, he performed at Richard’s 75th birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Danny was born in Teignmouth, Devon. He never knew his father, a miner who enrolled in the Royal Navy at the start of the second world war and was killed in action. Danny’s sister died soon after and he and his mother moved to Battersea, south-west London, where he attended Salesian college. He excelled in boxing and football as well as playing a variety of instruments, before settling on the upright bass. Having left school and home aged 15, Thompson earned a living playing bass in Soho strip clubs. After a year, he began working the American airbase circuit. Aged 18, he was arrested for failing to turn up for national service, and three days before being sent to Winchester barracks, married his girlfriend, Daphne Davis. He was then posted to Penang, Malaysia, for two years, where, against orders, he became involved with the local music scene. Returning to England in 1963 he took a job backing the American singer Roy Orbison – playing electric bass for the only time in his life – on a UK tour while watching headliners the Beatles kick off Beatlemania. In 1964 he spent £5 on buying his acoustic bass, Victoria – which he used his entire career – before joining Korner’s Blues Incorporated. Thompson was known for his warmth and good humour. He continued to practise for an hour a day. His mantra remained: “Music is like a religion, if you want to do something you have to work at it, you have to practise.” After embracing sobriety, Thompson set up Hero Productions to produce TV documentaries. His 1983 wildlife film A Passion to Protect (directed by Roy Deverell) won a Hugo award at the Chicago film festival. He converted to Islam in 1990, taking the Muslim name Hamza, and in 1999 he was interviewed for the BBC TV series Faces of Islam. The following year he travelled to Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem as the presenter of the documentary The Furthest Mosque. Thompson underwent major heart surgery in 1998, during which he suffered a stroke. Three months after his operation he organised an all-star charity concert in Sarajevo and he continued performing until ill health forced him to slow down several years ago. Thompson’s first marriage ended in divorce in the late 70s. In 1990 he married his partner Sylvia. She survives him, as does his son, Danny Jr, from his first marriage.",

    "title": "National Coffee Day 2025 : Free drinks at Dunkin , Smoothie King and more",
    "text": "Large and small coffee chains nationwide are celebrating National Coffee Day on Monday with free cups of joe and other deals. This year is especially important as chains try to reel in consumers who have been cutting back on discretionary spending. Americans have grown more cost-conscious due to fears of higher inflation, which have worsened in part due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policy. Coffee prices have jumped since Trump took office, which can be concerning for the roughly 66% of American adults who drink a cup every day, according to the National Coffee Association (NCA). Retail coffee prices in the United States rose nearly 21% in August compared to the same month last year — the largest annual jump since October 1997, according to the Consumer Price Index. Ninety-nine percent of coffee consumed in the United States is imported, according to the NCA. Brazil is the top source of US coffee imports, and is also one of the most heavily tariffed countries at 50%. A free coffee on National Coffee Day may come with the caveat that customers must buy another menu item, or sign up for an account in the store’s app. Such promotions can help businesses add loyal customers, particularly for a product like coffee, which is a staple for so many people. Here are some chains serving up deals: - Dunkin’ rewards members can get a free medium hot or iced coffee — not including a cold brew or nitro cold brew — as long as you make another purchase and order through the Dunkin’ app. - Starbucks is rewarding its members with 100 bonus stars if they order any sized hot or iced brewed coffee. Those points can be used later to order a free brewed hot or iced coffee, tea, bakery item or packaged snack. - Paris Baguette and Lavazza are partnering up so that Paris Baguette rewards members can get a free medium hot or iced coffee made with Lavazza beans, valid through the Paris Baguette app. - Smoothie King planned a brand crossover for Monday, so that Starbucks Rewards members can show their stars rewards for a free 20-ounce protein coffee smoothie. The chain said it will also accept rewards from other competitors, like Dunkin’. The rewards need to be shown in-store at checkout for a free protein coffee smoothie. - Pret A Manger will give customers who order on the app “one free organic, barista-made coffee.” - Krispy Kreme is offering a double deal: coffee drinkers may opt for a free medium hot or iced coffee with a free doughnut without requiring additional purchases. - Peet’s Coffee isn’t offering a free cup, but customers can use the code NCD25 for 25% off if they order online. - Tim Hortons is giving its rewards members a free coffee by way of 400 rewards points if customers order “four separate brewed coffee purchases” and scan for Tims Rewards each time, until October 4. - Panera is letting customers join its Unlimited Sip Club using the code “COFFEEDAY” for three months of free coffee, or teas and fountain drinks. CNN’s Jordan Valinsky and Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Trump vows to enact  substantial  tariffs on imported furniture",
    "text": "President Donald Trump threatened Monday to impose “substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States,” he wrote in a Truth Social post. “Details to follow!!!” he added. This comes after he announced last week that a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, as well as a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, would go into effect later this week. It’s unclear how Trump’s latest tariff threat would work; businesses, not countries, manufacture furniture. Typically, sectoral duties are charged uniformly regardless of the country of origin. Trump’s post, however, appears to hint at a tariff scheme that could call for higher levies on countries that ship more furniture to the United States than others. The White House did not immediately respond to CNN’s inquiry. The president initially announced plans last month to impose higher furniture tariffs by mid-October. Already, furniture prices in the United States have increased over the past few months as Trump hiked tariffs on countries including China and Vietnam, the top two sources of imported furniture. Both countries exported $12 billion worth of furniture and fixtures last year, according to US Commerce Department data. Furniture and bedding prices, an overarching category the Consumer Price Index tracks, rose 0.9% in July and 0.3% in August. Compared to August 2024, prices are 4.7% higher, the largest jump in three years. That’s a sharp contrast to most of the past two and a half years, when prices were falling. Trump, in his Monday morning post, said his impetus for levying higher furniture tariffs was to help North Carolina, which he claimed “has completely lost its furniture business to China, and other countries.” North Carolinians could play a crucial role in determining which party controls the Senate, with one seat up for election next year in their state, considered a major battleground race. In addition to furniture, Trump also threatened Monday to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-produced films. Last week, he said a 100% tariff on branded drugs, with some exceptions, and a 25% tariff on trucks would go into effect later this week. All this is happening ahead of a major Supreme Court case kicking off in November that studies whether Trump had the legal authority to impose country-specific tariffs in claiming an economic emergency. If the court rules against the Trump administration, businesses could be due large refunds on tariff payments. At the same time, Trump’s sectoral tariffs, which rely on a separate set of laws concerning national security, are not currently facing any legal challenges. This is a developing story and will be updated.",

    "title": "Live updates : Trump to meet Netanyahu as federal government shutdown looms",
    "text": "Where things stand • Netanyahu meeting: President Donald Trump is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While at the White House, Netanyahu apologized to Qatar over the Doha strike, according to an Israeli source. • Possible peace plan: Trump has been optimistic about reaching a resolution in the Middle East as he works to secure a Gaza peace plan. But Netanyahu is expected to present reservations and push for changes to the plan, three Israeli officials said. • Shutdown deadline looms: Meanwhile, the federal government is less than 48 hours away from shutting down. Congress has until midnight tomorrow to approve a federal spending bill. Would a federal government shutdown affect you? Tell us about it. Meanwhile, in Tel Aviv, protesters outside the US consulate call for a hostage deal Hundreds of protesters and activists positioned themselves outside the US consulate in Tel Aviv, calling for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal as Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump are meeting at the White House. Among protesters are members from the Women’s Protest Movement and families of hostages who called on Trump to “make history” by ending the war and bringing all Israeli hostages held in Gaza back home. “Netanyahu’s latest speech is yet another proof of his unimaginable detachment and of his policy of gimmicks instead of agreements,” the Women’s Protest Movement said in a statement. Many protesters were seen carrying banners that read, “President Trump-Make history! end the war and bring all hostages home,” and “Leave no hostage behind.” Other protesters were seen carrying posters of hostages who are still held in Gaza and heard chanting “save all hostages,” and “Trump, stop the war.” Smaller rallies were held elsewhere, including outside the US embassy in Jerusalem as family members of hostages still held in Gaza were among the protesters. In New York and Washington, DC, similar rallies took place, where protesters demanded an end to the war in Gaza and called for the safe return of all Israeli hostages. There could be no jobs report this Friday if the government shuts down, Labor Department says The September jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, could be delayed if the federal government shuts down. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ operations will largely go dark if funding is interrupted, according to contingency plans the Department of Labor outlined on Monday. The Labor Department’s plans indicate that only one BLS employee — interim commissioner William Wiatrowski — of the 2,055 will be working full-time during the lapse. If the jobs report is delayed, it could leave many businesses, economists, investors and policymakers flying blind at a critical moment in the US economy. Recent labor market data has shown that the jobs market is weaker than expected. The September report was expected to provide crucial context as to the stability of the foundation that underlies the US economy. However, jobless benefits would continue to be paid as long as state unemployment agencies have enough administrative funding to operate, the Labor Department’s plan said. Overall, the agency expects to only retain about 3,150 employees out of its roughly 13,000 staffers. It would continue dealing with imminent threats to human life, child labor investigations and disaster Dislocated Worker grant applications, as well as investigations into mines and high-hazard industries. Schumer won’t say if a GOP commitment to negotiate ACA subsidies would be enough for his vote Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would not say if a Republican commitment to negotiate on an extension for enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies before the end of the year would be enough for him to vote for the House-passed stopgap funding bill. Schumer responded to multiple questions with: “We’re ready to get to work, it’s about time.” Asked what he said to Senate Republican Leader John Thune to get this afternoon’s meeting with President Donald Trump on the books, Schumer replied, “I said just that: got to get to work. You can’t, can’t get anything done without a bipartisan negotiation, and we’ve been pushing and pushing and they finally felt the heat and agreed.” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Manu Raju earlier today that a promise of talks would not be enough because party leaders don’t trust Republicans to keep their word. “Enough with the games that Republicans have been playing connected to the health care of the American people,” Jeffries said, adding, “No one can trust their word on health care. Are you kidding me?” For context: Enough Senate Democrats would need to be satisfied with a commitment to negotiations to give Republicans the needed support to pass the stopgap funding bill Tuesday and avert a shutdown. Last March, Schumer faced an enormous amount of political heat from the Democratic base for agreeing to a House-passed bill, despite Jeffries’ opposition. Jeffries has said this time he trusts Schumer to stick with him. More than half of State Department employees will stop work if there's a government shutdown More than half of State Department direct-hire employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to a guidance document from the agency obtained by CNN. Out of nearly 27,000 total direct hire employees, roughly 10,000 employees occupy “excepted” positions, the document said. “’Excepted’ or ‘non-excepted’ status depends exclusively on the duties of the position,” the document said, and even if an office has available money to continue its work, “only excepted employees will continue working.” It is unclear if any of the roughly 17,000 people expected to be furloughed will then be laid off. The White House budget office instructed agencies to make plans for mass firings in the event of a government shutdown. The State Department undertook a sweeping reorganization, with more than 1,300 people fired, earlier this year. “Excepted” activities “include those necessary to respond to emergencies involving ‘the safety of human life or the protection of property,’ and those necessary for activities essential to national security, including the conduct of foreign affairs essential to national security,” the document said. Other activities must be approved by senior officials. “Consular operations domestically and abroad will remain operational” in order to issue passports and visas and assist US citizens abroad, the guidance document said. Public speeches will generally be canceled, and public messaging will be limited, though there will be some exceptions, according to the guidance. The State Department estimates it will take half a day to complete shutdown activities. Asked about their shutdown plans, a State Department spokesperson said, “In case Congressional Democrats decide to shut down the government, the State Department is undergoing all necessary planning efforts to sustain critical missions.” Netanyahu apologizes to Qatar over Doha strike while at White House, sources tell CNN Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Qatar over the Doha strike while at the White House, according to an Israeli source. Separately, a person familiar also confirmed Netanyahu apologized to the Qatari prime minister in a phone call from the White House. Netanyahu did not say he was sorry for targeting Hamas, the Israeli source said, but he did apologize to the prime minister for violating Qatar’s sovereignty in carrying out the strike. In an interview on Sunday, Netanyahu said, “Our goal was Hamas. Not anything beyond it. I think we can work out an understanding on this.” The Israeli source said the apology was part of a deal so that Qatar would put pressure on Hamas to accept the Trump administration’s 21-point proposal to end the war. The phone call was first reported by Axios. Netanyahu also apologized for harming a civilian. The strike killed a Qatari security guard who was in the building that was targeted. The leaders of Israel and Qatar have never been publicly reported to have formally met or spoken directly until Monday. However, secret and indirect contacts and diplomatic interactions have occurred for years. The phone call happened while Netanyahu was at the White House for a meeting with US President Donald Trump over the US-backed 21-point plan. Qatar is a critical mediator in ceasefire talks, able to communicate with Hamas, Israel and the US. Speaker Johnson says on private call he doesn't plan to bring House back this week Speaker Mike Johnson implored his Republican members on a private call this morning to stay unified in their position as the government barrels towards a shutdown and said he does not plan to bring the House back this week, two sources on the call told CNN. Johnson called on Republican lawmakers not to hold political events this week even though many will remain in their districts with the House not in session, the sources added. The speaker suggested he would bring the House back next week. The marching orders from Johnson to the House GOP conference comes just hours before the top four congressional leaders will meet with President Donald Trump at the White House to see if there is an eleventh-hour off ramp before the government runs out of funding Tuesday night. Providing a window into how GOP leaders are attempting to shape the party’s talking points ahead of a possible shutdown, the sources said House GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain walked members through internal polling to help them frame their arguments and stay on a unified message. McClain advised members to focus on the economic impacts of a shutdown — arguing that messaging around the uncertainty and stress it could cause to markets is where Republicans have the upper hand and a winning message — over discussing health care, which has been a red line for Democrats, the sources added. Johnson also indicated that congressional GOP leaders are planning to hold a joint news conference Wednesday, which would mark the first day of a shutdown, the sources told CNN. This post has been updated with additional reporting. Defiant Jeffries says Obamacare talks not enough to earn Democratic votes to avert shutdown House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democrats aren’t willing to trust that Republicans will be willing to negotiate on enhanced Affordable Care Act tax subsidies, digging in on the red line ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump as the country barrels toward a government shutdown. Asked if Democrats would back a seven-week funding bill if Republicans say they will negotiate an extension of the ACA subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of the year, Jeffries pointed to a Democratic-led government funding proposal that included a permanent extension of them. The Senate failed to pass that package, as well as the House-passed GOP funding bill, on Friday, leaving lawmakers at a stalemate ahead of a September 30 deadline. “Enough with the games that Republicans have been playing connected to the health care of the American people,” Jeffries said, adding, “No one can trust their word on health care. Are you kidding me?” The top House Democrat brought up previous GOP efforts to repeal the ACA, telling reporters, “On behalf of the American people, were supposed to simply take their word that they’re willing to negotiate. The American people know that would be an unreasonable thing for us.” Responding to Trump’s assertion that it’s up to Democrats whether the government shuts down, Jeffries said, “We’ve said from the beginning that we’re willing to find a bipartisan path forward.” Jeffries accused Republicans of trying to “misrepresent” the Democratic position, and he emphasized it’s already illegal for undocumented immigrants to receive federal health care benefits – as the GOP has suggested Democrats want. “Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we’re interested in changing federal law. The question for the president is whether he’s interested in protecting the health care of the American people,” he said. Trump spoke to Emir of Qatar ahead of Netanyahu meeting President Donald Trump spoke with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, earlier today, ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the White House. A Qatari adviser also visited the White House ahead of a crucial meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Qatar has been playing a critical role in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza, though those efforts were dealt a blow after Israel carried out an attack targeting Hamas leadership in Qatar. The White House’s hosting of the Qatari adviser could be an important step in trying to push forward the Trump administration’s 21-point plan to end the war in Gaza as it nears the two-year mark. It may serve as an attempt to ensure that the administration maintains pressure on Netanyahu to agree to a deal to end the war. The White House has signaled optimism, though, that a deal can be reached. Trump \"very confident\" in Gaza peace deal as meeting with Netanyahu gets underway President Donald Trump, greeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, said he’s “very confident” peace could be achieved in Gaza quickly. Trump made the remark after shaking Netanyahu’s hand at the West Wing portico. The two men are set to meet in the Oval Office this morning before convening a joint press conference. Both flashed a thumbs up before entering the White House. As Trump voiced confidence in striking an agreement that would end the war in Gaza and secure the release of remaining hostages, Netanyahu stood by smiling. He didn’t respond when asked if he was on board. Trump welcomes Netanyahu to White House Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived at the White House and was greeted by President Donald Trump. This marks Netanyahu’s fourth visit to the White House since the beginning of Trump’s second term. The two leaders are expected to discuss as Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Here's what's happening at the White House today As we await Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrival at the White House for his meeting with President Donald Trump, let’s take a look at what’s coming up today. Trump and Netanyahu are expected to hold a bilateral meeting to discuss a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, as we’ve reported. After that, Trump and Netanyahu will have a bilateral lunch at noon ET before they hold a joint-press conference, due for 1:15 p.m. ET. Then, at 3:00 p.m. ET, Trump will host a closed-door bipartisan bicameral leadership meeting inside the Oval Office as a federal government shutdown looms. At 5:30 p.m. ET the president will host a Gold Star Families Reception. Stay with us here for full coverage and the latest updates. Here's how the HHS would be affected by a shutdown We’ve been reporting on some departments’ plans if the federal government was to shut down on Wednesday. The US Department of Health and Human Services said its capacity to protect public safety would be greatly affected, even though it could continue some activities that ensure public health, according to its updated contingency plan. The US Food and Drug Administration’s ability to provide public health oversight would be harmed. “In the event of a lapse in appropriations, FDA’s ability to protect and promote public health and safety would be significantly impacted, with many activities delayed or paused,” the plan said. It would not be able to accept new drug applications or support staff that monitor the quality of compounded drugs unless an imminent safety threat is posed, for instance. The agency would be limited in the inspections it could conduct. Longer-term food safety initiatives would be halted, and regulatory testing of medical products would be limited. However, the FDA would maintain core functions to respond to emergencies. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue monitoring for disease outbreaks, but the agency’s communications to the public about health-related information would be “hampered,” the plan said. In addition, HHS would retain staff to support Medicare, Medicaid and other mandatory health program payments. However, it would only be able to focus on investigating the most serious incidents of patient harm at health care facilities. The agency would also halt other non-essential activities, including oversight of certain research contracts and grants, processing public inquiries and collecting and analyzing data. Overall, the agency would retain roughly 47,250 staffers, while furloughing about 32,450 employees. During shutdowns, federal departments designate essential employees to continue working, though they may not be paid until the impasse ends. The updated contingency plan also shows how deeply HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cut into the agency’s staffing as part of the Trump administration’s overhaul of the federal government. Departments have been outlining their shutdown plans Some departments have posted updated plans explaining how they’ll function if the government shuts down on Wednesday. Defense Department: Nearly 224,000 of the more than 741,000 civilian employees will be retained to protect life and property, along with nearly 2.1 million military personnel, according to the contingency plan. The plan notes that travel and participation in conferences supporting military operations against al-Qaeda and countering the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other terrorist groups can continue. But planned visits by foreign dignitaries should be canceled unless they support essential national security operations or the president’s conduct of foreign relations. Homeland Security: Only 14,000 employees out of the nearly 272,000 workers at the agency will be furloughed if funding lapses. Most employees in Customs and Border Patrol will be retained, as well those who work for Immigration and Customers Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service, Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. DHS said it will continue immigration and drug-related enforcement, passenger processing and cargo inspection at ports of entry, the US Secret Service, counter-terrorism watches, the Disaster Relief Fund and fee-funded programs. Education Department: Only a few employees would continue working if the federal government shuts down, according to the agency’s contingency plan. Nearly 1,500 of the department’s 1,700 workers would be furloughed, along with nearly 650 of its 750 staffers in the Office of Federal Student Aid, according to the plan. Most of the workers deemed essential would be retained to perform duties deemed necessary by law. The agency would continue to dole out Pell Grants and federal student loans and would keep making Title I and IDEA grant funding available. States, schools and others could still access the billions of dollars in awards the department made over the summer. Employees working on activities related to provisions in the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act would remain on the job. Far-right Israeli minister lays out \"red lines\" for Gaza deal ahead of Trump-Netanyahu meeting We reported earlier on what Israeli officials say are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s reservations about the White House’s 21-point Gaza ceasefire and post-war governance plan. A key member of the Israeli government has today also put forward strict conditions for a deal to end the war ahead of the White House meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump. Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared he adamantly opposes any involvement of the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza as well as any mention of future statehood for the Palestinians in a deal to end the war. Smotrich laid out a series of “non-negotiable” demands for the post-war Gaza plan in a lengthy post on X. Smotrich also outlined his party’s “red lines,” which include strong opposition to some of the reported components of the Trump administration’s post Gaza war plan. Among other demands, Smotrich called for a complete expulsion of Hamas’ leadership from Gaza and its full demilitarization. He also insisted on maintaining permanent Israeli military control over the territory’s perimeter and opposes withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor, an Israeli buffer zone on the Gaza-Egypt border. Beyond his objection to the PA’s involvement, Smotrich also demanded there be “no involvement of Qatar in Gaza.” He also said Gaza residents who wish to leave the strip would be allowed to do so through Egypt. Egypt has warned that no displacement of Palestinians should take place, particularly through its territory. Analysis: Trump will meet a politician transformed When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Donald Trump at the White House today, they will discuss a Middle East that has undergone radical change. The US president says a deal to end the war in Gaza is likely. But what’s on offer is politically problematic for Netanyahu – and much as the region has transformed, so has Netanyahu. His drastic change in approach makes it all the more difficult to predict what comes next. For years, Netanyahu’s approach to warfare was characterized by brief and contained conflicts, especially in Gaza. Operation Pillar of Defense, in 2012, for example, lasted just eight days. The current Gaza war will mark two years next month, the longest in Israel’s history. When he returned to power in 2009, Netanyahu declared that one of his goals would be eliminating Hamas. In practice, despite his rhetoric, Israel’s longest serving prime minister’s security policy was widely seen as cautious and relatively restrained, even derided as cowardly by political rivals, who also mocked his inability to make decisive moves. His years of big talk turned into small decisions. Then came October 7. Two days after the Hamas-led attack left more than 1,200 Israelis dead, Netanyahu promised Israelis “we are going to change the Middle East.” This time, he meant it. For two years, Israeli jets and special forces have undertaken daring missions, striking targets once thought untouchable, with regional capitals from Doha to Tehran and Damascus bearing the scars of Netanyahu’s pledge to reshape the Middle East after the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. White House signals optimism on ceasefire deal ahead of Trump meeting with Netanyahu We’ve been hearing from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt this morning on the prospect of a hostage and ceasefire deal being reached between Israel and Hamas. President Donald Trump is preparing to meet today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two leaders are set to hold a joint press conference after they meet, the strongest signal that they hope to be able to announce something substantial. “The president knows when you get to a good deal, both sides are going to leave a little bit unhappy, but we need this conflict to end. The president’s made that very clear,” she added. Asked if there is an expectation that Netanyahu will sign a hostage, ceasefire deal today, Leavitt stopped short of confirming, saying in part that the president “wants this to be the plan.” “The president believes strongly in this plan, and he wants this to be the plan, and he wants this war to come to an end,” Leavitt said. Even if Trump and Netanyahu were to announce a ceasefire deal Monday, Hamas would still need to sign on — and there is no indication that they have done so. White House says Trump is offering Democrats “one last chance” to negotiate government funding President Donald Trump is offering Democrats “one last chance” to negotiate the terms of government funding as a potential shutdown looms, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ahead of his meeting with top congressional leaders. “The president is giving Democrats one last chance to be reasonable today,” Leavitt told reporters outside the White House. “Look, there is nothing to negotiate when you have a clean CR.” Trump is expected to meet later today with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Leavitt also emphasized that the president wants to meet Tuesday’s funding deadline to avoid a government shutdown. “There are, of course, important policy discussions that can be had, but we are nearing a government shutdown, and we are nearing a funding deadline, and the president wants to make this deadline,” Leavitt said. When asked if there would be further government firings, Leavitt briefly said there will not be, “if Democrats vote to keep the government open.” Israeli officials say Netanyahu has reservations on ceasefire plan as Trump promises \"something special\" US President Donald Trump has promised “something special” is coming on Gaza as Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reservations at about the White House’s 21-point ceasefire and post-war governance plan. The two leaders will meet on Monday for a high-stakes discussion that Trump has boasted could end the war in Gaza. Trump projected optimism on Sunday as his administration works to close a comprehensive plan that would include the release of all hostages held by Hamas. “We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” Trump wrote on social media. “ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!! President DJT.” But in an interview with Fox News on yesterday afternoon, Netanyahu did not say he had accepted the plan. “We’re working on it,” he said. “It’s not been finalized yet.” Hamas said on Sunday that it had not received any new proposals for a ceasefire. In a statement, it reiterated “readiness to examine any proposals it receives from its mediator brothers in a positive and responsible manner, while upholding the national rights of our people.” Netanyahu is expected to present reservations and push for changes to the ceasefire plan, three Israeli officials said Sunday, underscoring the difficulty of closing a deal, even if many of the details have been worked out in advance. Read here for more on the background to the plan. What's in the US peace plan for Gaza? The Trump administration has proposed a 21-point Gaza peace plan that calls for all hostages held by Hamas to be released within 48 hours of an agreement and sets out a roadmap for Gaza once the war ends, according to a source familiar with the proposal. Meanwhile, Israel’s assault in the enclave continues, with the military escalating its offensive in recent days and forcing many to flee Gaza City as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) pushes deeper into the urban area. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, however, vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed. The plan could be problematic for Netanyahu, given it recognizes aspirations for a Palestinian state - something firmly opposed by key members of his government. See below for a summary, and you can read here for the background to the plan: • The release of the hostages – about 20 of whom are thought to be still alive – would be in exchange for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, according to the source. • The plan would deny Hamas any future role in the governance of Gaza, the source said. Instead, it calls for two levels of interim governance in the territory – an overarching international body and a Palestinian committee. • There is no timeline in the proposal for the international body to pass leadership of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises nominal self-rule in parts of the occupied West Bank, and faces heavy restrictions by Israel. • The plan does not indicate that the US would support the creation of a Palestinian state, but recognizes it as an aspiration of the Palestinians.

    "text": "Trump is pressing Netanyahu to accept his plan to end war in Gaza Listen live: NPR Special Coverage President Trump is expected to press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a new plan to end the war in Gaza during a meeting at the White House on Monday. The high-stakes meeting comes as the two-year anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel draws closer — and as a growing list of nations recognized Palestinian statehood last week during the United Nations General Assembly. Trump and Netanyahu are slated to hold a press conference at 1:15 p.m. ET. Listen to NPR's live special coverage by tapping the audio player above. You can also watch the press conference live here: Trump has so far backed Israel, insisting that Hamas release all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza since Oct. 7, and charging that recognizing Palestinian statehood \"rewards\" Hamas. Trump has also raised expectations for an agreement, even before Israel and Hamas have signed off. \"I think we have a deal,\" Trump told reporters on Friday. The multiple-point proposal the U.S. shared with regional partners would end Israel's war in the territory, boost aid to Gaza and require Hamas to release remaining Israeli hostages within 48 hours. A coalition of international partners would supervise the reconstruction of Gaza, a source familiar with the plans told NPR. World Trump and Netanyahu to meet amid mounting pressure to end war in Gaza Trump and Netanyahu to meet amid mounting pressure to end war in Gaza Trump has been one of Netanyahu's strongest supporters, but he has grown increasingly frustrated with the prime minister as the war has dragged on and the loss of lives has grown. Earlier this month, Trump claimed he was blindsided when Israel launched a strike against Hamas officials in Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator in ceasefire talks. Ivo Daalder, who served as a U.S. ambassador to NATO in the Obama administration, said Monday's meeting is seen as a real test for Trump to see how willing he is to use U.S. leverage in a way that he hasn't so far. \"It's the real indicator whether he wants peace. Not just because he wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but because he wants an end to conflict,\" Daalder said. \"Because the world is against Israel and the United States. There's no one else. And he's the only one who can shift Netanyahu.\"",

    "title": "Overseas Hong Kong pro - democracy activist Nathan Law denied entry to Singapore",
    "text": "BEIJING — An activist wanted by the Hong Kong government said he was denied entry to Singapore over the weekend for what he presumes were political reasons. Nathan Law, who fled Hong Kong in 2020 and is based in London, said he was detained at the Singapore airport on Saturday night and told four hours later that his entry had been denied. He was going to attend a closed-door, invitation-only event, he said in a statement, without elaborating. Law is one of a number of Hong Kong activists who have left the city in recent years after the adoption of a National Security Law that has put others in prison. He said he had received a visa from Singapore to attend the event and departed on a flight from San Francisco. No reason was given for the denial, he said. He boarded a plane back to San Francisco on Sunday after about 14 hours in Singapore. \"I think the decision to deny my entry was political, although I am unsure whether external forces, such as the PRC, are involved, directly or indirectly,\" his statement said, referring to China by the acronym for its official name, the People's Republic of China. Law declined further comment. A Singapore government statement confirmed that he had been refused entry, saying a visa holder is subject to further checks at the border. It noted that Hong Kong police have issued a warrant for Law's arrest under the city's National Security Law. \"Law's entry into and presence in the country would not be in Singapore's national interests,\" the statement from the Home Affairs Ministry said. Singapore has an extradition agreement with Hong Kong but it doesn't appear to cover national security crimes. Hong Kong police issued warrants for Law and other self-exiled activists in 2023 and offered rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($127,600) for information leading to their arrest. Law is accused of colluding with foreign parties and inciting secession for allegedly calling for sanctions and Hong Kong's separation from China in meetings with foreign officials and in open letters, petitions, social media posts and media interviews. Hong Kong is a Chinese territory with its own laws and regulations, but the central government in Beijing cracked down in 2020 after massive anti-government the previous year, imposing a National Security Law on the city of 7.5 million people. Law rose to prominence as a student leader of the pro-democracy Umbrella Revolution in 2014 along with Joshua Wong, who is imprisoned in Hong Kong. Law was elected to the legislature in 2016 but disqualified after he raised his tone while swearing allegiance to China during the oath of office, making it sound like a question.

    "title": "3 things to know about Trump plan to send troops to Portland and Memphis",
    "text": "President Trump says he has ordered the deployment of troops to Portland, Ore., and that he's authorized them to use \"full force\" to curb protests outside U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. It's the latest instance of Trump deploying the military to various cities that he says are plagued with crime, with federal troops also expected to arrive in Memphis, Tenn., this week. We break down what's going on, how officials in Portland and Memphis are responding, and how this fits into a larger picture. 1. Expect another legal fight Like many of Trump's announcements, the Portland push started with a post on Saturday on his social media platform, Truth Social. He called Portland \"war ravaged\" — which is not the case on the ground there — and said he had authorized the Pentagon to provide troops. \"I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,\" Trump wrote in the post. \"I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.\" It was unclear from that post what troops he meant. NPR reached out to the Pentagon for clarity on Saturday, and a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly said the Pentagon had not issued a deployment order for Portland and that it only learned of Trump's request from the media. That official also said it would be likely that National Guard troops would be used. All of this comes after there were reports of a ramp-up of federal officers at an ICE facility in Portland on Friday, which Mayor Keith Wilson called a show of force and told residents to remain calm and not react. By Sunday, Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) reported that the Trump administration called 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service for a 60-day deployment, according to a memo from the Department of Defense to Gov. Tina Kotek. And hundreds of protesters gathered outside Portland's ICE facility late into Sunday night. Both the governor of Oregon and the mayor of Portland dispute Trump's claims that the city is unsafe or in need of troops and have been urging residents to remain peaceful. OPB reported Sunday that Oregon's top officials and the city of Portland were filing a federal lawsuit arguing that the administration had overreached and acted unlawfully. In a press conference Saturday, Mayor Keith Wilson said the necessary troops needed for the city is zero. \"This is an American city. We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target,\" he said. 2. Trump has been making these kinds of threats for months In Washington, D.C., where Trump has federal control, more than 2,000 National Guard troops from a variety of states have been deployed for more than a month in what Trump has said is an effort to crack down on crime. Back in June, Trump also federalized California's National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes and deployed them along with the Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against ICE deportations there. That sounds similar to what could happen in Portland. And then there are a handful of cities that Trump has threatened — about a dozen at this point, all Democratically led. Places like Chicago, where he also used the war metaphor but has yet to actually send troops. Earlier this month, Trump posted online that Chicago was \"about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" referencing his call to rename the Defense Department. And then there is Memphis. Trump has authorized the use of the National Guard there as part of a similar crackdown, along with other federal agents who are all expected to start arriving as early as this week. The Trump administration has described Memphis as \"suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government's ability to respond effectively.\" Memphis, which is the second-biggest city in Tennessee, is run by a Democratic mayor. Meanwhile, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has said he not only welcomed federal assistance, but that he has been in \"constant communication\" with the Trump administration for months about a plan to curb crime in Memphis using federal and state resources. 3. A larger picture is becoming clear The National Guard is not trained for community policing or to make arrests, and that's not how they're generally used. In Washington, D.C., they've mainly been patrolling federal property and beautifying city parks. Yet Trump says these National Guard deployments are to deal with crime. And he also has been conflating the work of troops with wider immigration and deportation efforts. We've seen that in Washington, D.C., for example, where ICE agents moved in along with the National Guard deployment and started detaining people at high rates. Legal experts have also said that another part of this that has them worried is the normalization of troops — sometimes armed — on U.S. streets. The U.S. has a long history of limiting the role of the military domestically, and experts say these kinds of continued threats and deployments challenge laws that are centuries old and central to the ideas that the U.S. was founded on. We have unpacked more about what experts tell us in this piece, and you can find more of our coverage on this wider issue here: - Trump walks back Chicago 'war' threat, but vows to 'clean up' cities - How Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans are reacting to Trump's National Guard threats - Judge rules against National Guard in LA, and Trump vows to send them to Chicago Copyright 2025 NPR",

    "title": "Top congressional leaders head to the White House ahead of shutdown deadline",
    "text": "The top four leaders in Congress are scheduled to meet with President Trump on Monday afternoon at the White House, just ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. The Oval Office meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is set to occur ahead of an expected Senate vote on a short-term stopgap bill. House Republicans narrowly passed a continuing resolution earlier this month that would fund the government through Nov. 21. That measure failed in the Senate because of Democratic opposition. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the chamber; they need 60 votes to pass the legislation. \"We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican health care crisis. Time is running out,\" said Jeffries and Schumer on Saturday in a statement regarding the White House meeting. A meeting redo Monday's Oval Office meeting comes after President Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting last week with the two Democratic leaders. \"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\" Trump posted on social media. Democrats are pushing to make permanent expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, and repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP's spending and tax bill bill passed earlier this summer. Republicans are pushing to fund the government first, and then negotiate on the subsidies. \"[The expiry date] doesn't happen until the end of the year. We can have that conversation,\" Thune said on Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. \"But before we do, release the hostage, set the American people free, keep the government open and let's have a conversation about those premium tax credits. I'm certainly open to that.\" But top Democrats have repeatedly said a handshake agreement on a future negotiation about the subsidies isn't enough. \"We need a serious negotiation,\" Schumer said in a separate appearance on Sunday's Meet the Press. \"Now, if the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won't get anything done. But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation.\" The clock is ticking Without congressional action, government funding will expire at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 1. While critical services would continue, like Social Security and payments from Medicare and Medicaid, there could be delays in processing new applications for those programs. In a shutdown, anything deemed nonessential is put on hold, so Americans could experience delays in certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay. In a move to seemingly raise the stakes, the White House's budget arm instructed federal agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently, instead of the traditional temporary furlough. Congressional Democrats panned the memo as an intimidation tactic. \"This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told NPR. \"Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.\" If the administration makes good on its threat, it could mean that whenever the federal government does reopen, it would have a smaller workforce.

Today's top stories At least four people are dead and eight others have been hospitalized after a man drove his truck into a Mormon church and began shooting in Michigan yesterday morning. He then set the building on fire. An unknown number of people are unaccounted for, and authorities are searching the burnt shell of the church for more victims. The gunman, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, was killed after exchanging gunfire with two law enforcement officers. - 🎧 Sanford, a former U.S. Marine, lived in a small town about 20 minutes from the church, Michigan Public reporter Steve Carmody tells Up First. At this point in the investigation, a possible motive for the attack is unknown, as well as whether Sanford had any relationship with the church or someone who was attending the service, Carmody says. Today, more information is expected to be released about the victims and when the first funerals will be held. Carmody says people in the community have expressed shock and have been overwhelmed by the news. Four top congressional leaders, two from each party, are scheduled to meet with President Trump today at the White House. This meeting comes ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Democrats are needed to help clear a 60-vote threshold in the Senate and avoid a government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were supposed to meet with Trump last week, but the president canceled, saying that he thought their demands were unreasonable. - 🎧 Schumer and Jeffries, along with their Republican counterparts, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, will attend the meeting with Trump. NPR's Barbara Sprunt says she doesn't believe that Democrats' demands have shifted since last week's canceled meeting. Democrats want to undo some cuts to healthcare programs and make some expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act permanent. If a shutdown were to happen, the White House has instructed agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently. Trump is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the White House. The president has proposed a 21-point peace plan for Gaza. The U.S. is still negotiating the details with Israel and Arab countries. - 🎧 The proposal calls for Hamas to release all 48 of its remaining hostages, living and dead, a person briefed on the plan confirmed to NPR's Daniel Estrin. Once that demand is met, the plan calls for a gradual process where a multinational Arab and Muslim peacekeeping force enters Gaza while Israeli forces withdraw. Estrin says this is the most serious effort yet since Trump entered office to end the war and plan a postwar future for Gaza. There are some difficult points left to resolve, such as disarming Hamas and the role of the Palestinian Authority after the war. Notably, this is an Israel-U.S. negotiation and not an Israel-Hamas one, Estrin says. Next week will mark two years of the war in Gaza. Cost of living NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. Home prices surged during the pandemic, and they have remained elevated. The median monthly payment for a home purchased in 2024 was $2,207, compared to $1,525 for a home bought in 2021, according to an analysis by Bankrate. The first two years of the pandemic saw low mortgage rates and work-from-home policies create a rush in homebuying, which led to a significant increase in home prices. In 2022, mortgage rates shot up and homebuying slowed significantly. Here's how the high housing prices have impacted people: - 🏠 Some Americans have opted to have smaller families than they once envisioned to be able to make the price of housing and day care work. - 🏠 Homeowners who bought a house before rates increased in 2022 locked in super low interest rates that they can keep forever. This has caused them to feel stuck in place, in a home that might not fit their needs anymore. - 🏠 Some people who have bought homes in the last few years feel squeezed by monthly payments that leave little cash left over. - 🏠 Many people who haven't bought a home are unsure when they will be able to afford one. High rents make it hard to save for a down payment. Read more about how housing prices are impacting people's plans for the future. Plus, here's why some friends are teaming up to buy homes.

Life advice Understanding the fundamentals of road safety may seem straightforward, but they are crucial for saving lives. In 2024, approximately 7,100 pedestrians were killed on the road, and more than 1,000 cyclists were hit and killed annually in recent years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Ryan Sharp, a transportation consultant, and Julia Kite-Laidlaw, a pedestrian and cyclist safety advocate with the National Safety Council, share their top dos and don'ts for walkers and bikers with Life Kit: - 🚲 Look in all directions and turn around before walking or biking across a road. A driver might not see you in a crosswalk when turning into an intersection. - 🚲 Always walk on the sidewalk or a walking path. If neither is an option, walk on the shoulder of the street against traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and vice versa. - 🚲 If biking at night, put white lights at the front and red lights at the back of your bike so cars can see you. - 🚲 No listening to music or podcasts in your headphones or looking at your phone. This can distract and prevent you from hearing or seeing oncoming traffic. - 🚲 Use turn signals when cycling. The easiest rules to remember are to keep the left arm straight out for a left turn and the right arm straight out for a right turn.

    "text": "Rory McIlroy responds to 'abusive' crowd behavior after historic Ryder Cup win The six-time Ryder Cup champ hailed his wife's poise. Team Europe retained the 2025 Ryder Cup on their opponent's soil at Bethpage Black, despite an inspired rallying effort from Team USA in the final day of singles matches and in the face of hecklers and crowd chaos on the course. Shane Lowry sank his birdie putt on 18 to clinch the 14 points needed for Europe to retain the coveted trophy -- the first time since 2012 the away team has won a Ryder Cup. \"I was bullish about our chances, but this has just been a dream week. It obviously was really tight there at the end. It was a bit stressful, but the big lad sitting right there next to Luke [Donald] played an unbelievable last four holes, and he carried me through the afternoon we had as well,\" Rory McIlroy said, referring to his compatriot, Lowry, in the post-win team press conference. \"Absolute legend, along with everyone else sitting up here. Just so happy that we could get it done.\" Rory McIlroy responds to rowdy Ryder Cup fans' 'abusive behavior' McIlroy has become Team Europe's most experienced player with six Ryder Cup wins to his name, but until this weekend had never endured a torrent of abuse at the premier biennial golf tournament like he did from the rowdy New York crowd. \"There was a lot of language that was unacceptable and abusive behavior,\" he said. People on the course were squeaking toy rubber ducks mid-swing, hurling baiting remarks from behind the ropes, and an American master of ceremonies even stepped down from her role after leading vulgar chants toward McIlroy. \"I don't think we should ever accept that in golf,\" the 36-year-old five-time major champion said. \"I think golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week. Golf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you very good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people,\" McIlroy said. \"Sometimes this week, we didn't see that. So no, this should not be what is acceptable in the Ryder Cup.\" He added, \"We will be making sure to say to our fans in Ireland in 2027 that what happened here this week is not acceptable -- come and support your home team.\" McIlroy said there were some moments when he chirped back and other times when he simply played through it. \"Honestly, I'd say it's just on impulse. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I'm quite an impulsive character, if you haven't noticed,\" he began. \"I chirped back a few times because it got to me a few times, but we tried to handle everything that came our way with class and poise, and for the most part, I felt like we did that.\" While McIlroy directly addressed the negative subsets of fans, he added, \"It's a minority of the crowd it's not the majority.\" \"The majority of people here are true golf fans and are respectful and let both teams have the same chance to hit the shots and play a fair contest,\" he said. In what he called \"a rough week for all of us,\" McIlroy put a point on things, adding, \"We shut them up by our performance and how we played.\" The win adds to an illustrious year for McIlroy, who completed the career grand slam with his 2025 Masters victory after a 10-year drought at the four majors. Another on-course kerfuffle that directly impacted McIlroy was when a fan's drink got launched airborne and partially hit his wife, Erica McIlroy. \"Erica is fine. She's a very, very strong woman. You know, she handled everything this week with class and poise and dignity like she always has,\" he said of his wife, adding that this type of behavior \"should be off-limits, but obviously it wasn't this week.\" Lowry, who played alongside McIlroy for the four-ball pairings, said, \"I was out there for two days with Erica McIlroy, and the amount of abuse that she received was astonishing and the way she was out there supporting her husband and supporting her team was unbelievable, and kudos to her for that.\" His longtime Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose \"had no idea\" until Rory was asked about Erica in the team press conference Sunday that there was an incident on the course. \"Fair play to Erica. She didn't bring that to the team room. We didn't make that a big deal. That's news to me. That says a lot about the strength of Erica and everybody on this team,\" Rose said. Justin Thomas says Ryder Cup crowd was 'nasty' to McIlroy, Lowry In his fourth Ryder Cup for Team USA, Justin Thomas paired up with New York native and first-time teammate Cameron Young to face off against the famed Irish duo on Saturday, witnessing the negative energy from the crowd firsthand. \"There was definitely some nasty things said,\" Thomas said in the team press conference following the 15-13 loss to Europe. \"Cam and I said it to Shane and Rory yesterday that we felt for them. It was unfortunate.\" He added, \"Cam and I just wished that we gave them something to cheer for instead of people to cheer against. I think that was kind of the main consensus of the last two days, that we weren't giving them enough to cheer for, and they were just trying to help us win.\" The Ryder Cup will return to Ireland in 2027 for the second time as Adare Manor, in County Limerick, plays host to the contest between Europe and the United States for the first time.",

    "title": "A drug made from marijuana reduced back pain in a large study",
    "text": "A drug made from marijuana reduced back pain in a large study A medication made from marijuana successfully reduced back pain in a new study WASHINGTON -- An experimental medication made from marijuana successfully reduced back pain in a new study, offering further support for the drug’s potential in treating one of the most common forms of chronic pain. The 800-patient study by a German drugmaker is the latest evidence of the therapeutic properties of cannabis, which remains illegal under U.S. federal law even as most states have made it available for medical or recreational use. Health officials in Canada and Europe have previously approved a pharmaceutical-grade form of cannabis for several types of pain, including nerve pain due to multiple sclerosis. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug containing CBD — one of the many non-intoxicating chemicals found in cannabis — to treat rare seizures in children with epilepsy. Unlike that drug, known as Epidiolex, the new cannabis formula from drugmaker Vertanical contains THC, the active ingredient in marijuana that gets users high. But levels of the chemical are very low, essentially a microdose compared to what’s available in gummies, chocolate bars and other products sold at marijuana dispensaries in the U.S. The company said patients in the trial didn’t show any signs of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal. Vertanical is seeking approval for a large group of patients: those suffering from lower-back pain, a chronic condition that affects millions and has few proven treatments. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can’t be used for long-term pain because of their side effects, which include stomach ulcers and indigestion. Opioids are no longer recommended, after the overprescribing of painkillers such as OxyContin in the 1990s and 2000s led to the ongoing epidemic of addiction to that class of drug. Chronic pain is one of the most frequently cited conditions of people enrolled in state-run medical marijuana programs. But there's been little rigorous research on the drug's use in that group. Lead study author Dr. Matthias Karst said in an email that the new findings show cannabis \"can significantly reduce pain and improve physical function in patients with chronic low-back pain, without the safety concerns commonly associated with opioids.” Karst is a pain specialist at Hannover Medical School and a consultant for Vertanical. For the new study, patients with back pain were randomly assigned to take Vertanical’s proprietary liquid cannabis extract or a placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, patients taking the medication reported a nearly 2-point reduction in pain on an 11-point scale, compared with 1.4 points for those taking placebo. The difference was statistically significant. Those getting the drug also reported improvements in sleep and physical function. Patients who continued with a six-month extension phase continued to experience reductions in pain. The results were published Monday in the journal Nature. Side effects included dizziness, headache, fatigue and nausea and led to more than 17% of people discontinuing the drug early. Researchers said that dropout rate was lower than what's typically reported with opioids, which can cause constipation, nausea, drowsiness and carry risks of addiction. Vertanical has filed an application for its drug with European regulators. In the U.S., the company says it is “working closely” with regulators to design a study to support FDA approval. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "title": "Trump confident ahead of Monday showdown , says Democrat position makes shutdown likely :  I just dont know how were going to solve this issue  ",
    "text": "Trump confident ahead of Monday showdown, says Democrats' position makes shutdown likely: \"I just don't know how we're going to solve this issue\" Washington — President Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position. \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News. Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that the American people will side with him if government funding expires in the coming days, and he believes Democrats will pay a political price for not working with him, on his terms, to further cut spending. \"They're not interested in fraud, waste and abuse,\" Mr. Trump said of the Democrats. Mr. Trump will meet Monday with congressional leaders ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for lawmakers to reach an agreement on a spending bill that would avert a shutdown. A source close to Mr. Trump told CBS News that the president privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it will enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries. Last week, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown. The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices — a federal term for layoffs — for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\" In the interview Sunday, Mr. Trump cast the Democrats' current demands — which in recent weeks have focused on seeking to extend Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies — as ill-advised. Instead, Mr. Trump said, if the Democrats want to discuss health care, they should work with him to prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public benefits. \"The Democrats, incredibly, want to keep their old policies of open borders and we're not going to have it. We're not going to allow it,\" Mr. Trump said. Any possible health-care negotiations, Mr. Trump added, must address immigration and border-related matters, otherwise, \"It's just not acceptable for us.\" Democrats have forcefully pushed back against Mr. Trump's characterization of their positions on both government funding and on immigration. And they have repeatedly noted that people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage. \"Donald Trump knows, or at least I think he knows, that current federal law prohibits using taxpayer dollars for undocumented immigrants in connection with their health care. And no one is trying to change or reverse that law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told MSNBC on Saturday. \"What we are doing is fighting to protect the healthcare of everyday Americans in the midst of this Republican-caused crisis that is devastating hospitals and nursing homes and community-based health clinics.\" Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet Monday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Jeffries. The meeting comes after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands. Earlier this month, the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But Democrats put forward their own proposal that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31, along with implementing other priorities for the party, including their health-care request. In the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation, both the bill passed by the House House-passed bill to fund the government and the Democrats' proposal fell short. The Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The proposal would also roll back cuts to Medicaid in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year. The Senate is returning to Washington on Monday after a weeklong recess, and will have little time to act to avert a shutdown. Echoing Mr. Trump, Thune told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that it's \"totally up to the Democrats\" whether the government shuts down, saying \"there is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now\" that the House passed that would keep the government open. \"This decision, in my judgment at this point in time, is up to a handful of Democrats,\" Thune said. \"We need eight Democrats to pass it through the Senate.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, told \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that \"Democrats are united in pushing\" on the health-care issue, adding that she's glad the president has decided to meet with leaders in Congress. \"This is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem, and that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis,\" Klobuchar said. \"My constituents, Americans, are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them.\"",

    "title": "FBI investigating Michigan church shooting , fire as  an act of targeted violence  ",
    "text": "All are accounted for after Michigan church shooting, officials say; FBI probing as \"act of targeted violence\" Everyone is now accounted for in the aftermath of a shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services, authorities said during a press conference Monday. The FBI is investigating the Grand Blanc Township melee as \"an act of targeted violence.\" About 100 people were inside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McClandlish Road around 10:25 a.m. Sunday when the shooting happened. The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired \"several rounds\" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. Four victims were killed in the shootings. The shooter is also dead, officials said. One victim was listed in critical condition at an area hospital, and seven others were reported to be in stable condition. Henry Ford Genesys Hospital said it provided care for some of the victims. Monday's press conference was the final in a series of in-person reports, with local police saying additional updates will come from their social media. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was among those who spoke Monday, alongside FBI Detroit acting special agent in charge Reuben C. Coleman, Genesee County Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson, ATF special agent in charge of the Detroit Field Office James Deir and Michigan State Police Director Col. James F. Grady II. Deir asked that area residents avoid the area near the church, which has been blocked off, asking for cooperation from the public as investigators continue to comb through the wreckage left by the fire. Over 100 victims and witnesses have been interviewed so far, Coleman said. In the meantime, the authorities praised the dedication of first responders and law enforcement at the scene, some of whom had only two months experience on the job, along with the immediate response of the church attendees during the incident. \"There are noble heroes who do not wear a uniform that went to that church yesterday .... Those heroes from that church did their job,\" the sheriff said. Survivor Paul Kirby told \"CBS Mornings\" it was \"the scariest moment of my life, not knowing if my family was OK.\" Kirby's wife and children were with him, attending a service at the church, when they heard \"a loud boom coming from the back wall of the chapel.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said investigators were looking into how much planning went into the attack and whether any clues about the motive were left behind. \"From what I understand, based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith,\" she said Monday. The shooting occurred a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Utah-based faith, died at 101. Sanford was an Iraq war veteran who deployed once for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided to CBS News by the Pentagon. Sanford served in the Marines for four years. Crews in white coveralls and hard hats searched through what remained of the church on Monday morning. A silver pickup truck with two American flags in the back remained where it had smashed into the front brick wall near a sign that says \"visitors welcome.\" U.S. officials and state lawmakers shared messages in response to the shooting, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff through Friday to honor and remember the victims. Grand Blanc Community Schools was closed Monday. Bloomfield Township Police says it will \"increase patrols around our places of worship and other community gatherings to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.\" The shooting was the latest of several attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the investigation, has asked anyone with information to call 1-800-225-5324 or submit a tip here.",

    "text": "Gunman in Michigan church shooting died after \"exchanging gunfire\" with police. Here's what we know. Police in Grand Blanc, Michigan, say the gunman who killed at least four people and injured eight others at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Sunday morning died after \"exchanging gunfire\" with police. The suspect was identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. Sanford served in the U.S. Marines for three-and-a-half years from 2004 to 2008, CBS News has confirmed. He was deployed from August 2007 to March 2008 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, which led to the fall of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. According to Renye, calls about the shooting at the Church of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road came in around 10:25 a.m., and officers were at the scene less than a minute later. Police said Sanford died at the parking lot of the church around 10:33 a.m. Sanford lived around eight miles away from the church. Michigan State Police and a bomb squad were investigating his home throughout the evening on Sunday. Investigators say there may be bomb making materials inside, though it's unknown if anything was found. Nearby residents told CBS News Detroit they couldn't believe what happened in their small suburban community located about an hour northwest of Detroit. \"I really feel for the families, you know, even feel for the accused,\" resident April Vann said. \"It's just a sad, really sad situation. You know, family's lives are destroyed in 2.2 seconds.\" Jason Miller, another nearby resident, said something has to change. \"It's troubling. A mile from home, you know? It's obviously getting closer to us, right?\" Miller said. \"So when it starts getting close, you're not just looking at the TV screen saying, 'I feel bad. What's going on?' It's here now, and that's why we got to do something. It's getting to be a problem.\" Several neighbors weren't able to get inside their homes on Sunday afternoon. Michigan State Police troopers said they would be in the area into the evening. President Trump said on Truth Social that Sunday's shooting was \"horrendous,\" and that he would provide \"full support\" to state and local officials for the investigation.",

    "text": "Does homebuying make sense this fall? Pros and cons experts say to know now Over the past few years, prospective homebuyers had to contend with elevated mortgage interest rates, low for-sale inventory and steep home prices. These factors have kept many would-be homebuyers on the sidelines, but the housing landscape is starting to shift, at least somewhat. Mortgage rates have declined overall for the last few weeks, for example, and recently hit a three-year low. Housing inventory is at its highest level since May 2020, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Federal Reserve also just conducted its first rate cut of 2025, lowering the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point as it tries to balance increasing inflation and a shaky labor market. Future Fed rate cuts could be on the horizon as well. Given these conditions, does homebuying make sense this fall? Here's what experts have to say on the subject. Compare your top mortgage loan options online now. Does homebuying make sense this fall? Pros and cons experts say to know now If you're thinking of purchasing a home soon, here are three pros and cons experts say to be aware of this fall homebuying season. Pros of buying a home this fall The advantages of buying a home this fall include: Less competition People buy homes at all times of the year, but the peak homebuying season tends to be in the spring and summer. That could be a major advantage for you if you're looking to buy this fall. \"There's less competition. A lot of families don't want to move and pull their kids out of school to move into a different district, and so that just creates less competition for the buyer,\" says Bill Banfield, chief business officer at Rocket Mortgage. Find out how affordable the right mortgage loan could be today. Potential incentives The fall homebuying season may come with another major advantage. As we get closer to the end of the year, lenders may offer potential incentives to help them meet their annual goals or drum up business during a typically slow time of the year. \"Some lenders who are trying to hit specific year-end quotas may drop rates or offer other incentives to bring borrowers in the door as we head towards the end of the year,\" says Sarah DeFlorio, vice president of mortgage banking at William Raveis Mortgage. So while you're looking at homes for sale, research various lenders to compare your borrowing options. You may be able to take advantage of extra incentives this time of year. Possibility of quick equity Home values have seen monumental growth recently, and if that trend continues, it could pay off for buyers who make a move now. \"It does feel like we're in a little bit of a sweet spot of improved interest rates, moderate demand and heightened supply, so it does feel like a really good sweet spot for folks to be aggressively searching for homes,\" says Jason Lerner, branch manager at First Home Mortgage. Over the past five years, for example, home values rose by 45.3%, according to Zillow data. While that has made it tough to break into the market, it could also mean that you're able to build equity faster than normal. \"I do think someone would be better positioned to buy today than they will be tomorrow, and then even more so, waiting for a spring season to hit again,\" says Lerner. Cons of buying a home this fall And, here are several potential disadvantages of buying a home this fall: Lower inventory If you want to buy a home in the fall, you could benefit from less competition. The other side of the coin is that there may also be a lower housing inventory, as sellers tend to list their homes in the spring and summer months. In other words, you may have less competition, but there may also be fewer options to choose from compared to the peak homebuying seasons. \"You're entering the period where there could be less homes available, and it might be a little tougher to find the home that you like,\" Banfield says. Future rate opportunities The Fed's actions don't directly affect mortgage rates, but the Fed does have a big impact on where rates head over time. And, the Federal Reserve made its first cut to the federal funds rate in September, which resulted in mortgage rates dropping to a three-year low on average. Mortgage rates may have the potential to fall further, however, as the Fed is widely expected to cut rates again in the near future. So, if you buy now, you could miss out on lower rates if they happen. Remember, though, that waiting for rates to fall further can be risky for other reasons. So, be sure to weigh both sides before making any moves. \"If you think that waiting a few months might bring rates down a bit, you could be right, but it will also mean increased competition and potentially losing out on a fabulous property that was the right fit for you,\" says DeFlorio. Possible holiday delays Later in the fall, homebuying could be complicated by the holidays, as logistical challenges could arise. As people travel for the holiday season or take time off, it could result in delays in terms of showings, inspections or other home-related requirements. Plus, you may have higher expenses during this season, which could further complicate matters. The bottom line Prospective homebuyers have had to deal with elevated home costs and a high-rate environment throughout much of 2025. But thanks to a recent drop in mortgage interest rates, buying during the fall season could be a good move, at least for some buyers. Others, though, may find it more beneficial to wait, as there are also a few potential downsides to making your move now.",

    "title": "How to sell your gold investment for a profit now , according to experts",
    "text": "How to sell your gold investment for a profit now, according to experts The price of gold has surged at numerous points in recent years, breaking record after record amid a shifting economic landscape. And, with the price now sitting at $3,800 per ounce (as of September 29, 2025), gold has hit another all-time high. One reason for the price uptick is that gold investing has grown in popularity recently, as investors can use the precious metal to protect their wealth from losses due to economic uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions and persistent inflation, which erode the value of the dollar. When things start to feel shaky, many turn to gold investments as a way to hedge against inflation while diversifying their portfolios and protecting against stock market losses — and that's precisely what happened over the last year or two. Many investors flocked to gold amid the inflationary environment, and a significant number of them bought at a much lower price than you could get today, meaning that there may be room to turn a profit now that gold's price is sitting above $3,800 per ounce. If you invested in gold at this same point a year ago, for example, when the gold price was $2,630 per ounce, your gold investment would be up by about 31%. Given this remarkable rise, those who bought early may be wondering how they can sell for a profit now. Here's what the experts have to say about that. Find out how you can add gold to your investment portfolio today. How to sell your gold investment for a profit now, according to experts If you want to sell your gold investment, here's how experts say you can get started. Evaluate whether it's the right time to sell First, you have to assess whether now is the right time to sell. The Federal Reserve just conducted its first rate cut of 2025 and more could be coming later this year. When the Federal Reserve cuts rates, gold prices typically go up, as interest-bearing accounts like certificates of deposit (CDs) or savings accounts become less appealing due to lower earning opportunities. \"Whether now is a good time to sell or not depends on individual circumstances. If you need the money and you're sitting on a potential profit, now's a great time. But most analysts agree the gold top isn't in yet, so it may pay to wait further,\" says Brett Elliott, director of marketing at American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX). Learn more about the benefits of gold investing here. Review your gold investments If you're looking to sell gold, the type you own plays a role, as the selling process varies based on your particular gold investment. Common gold investing types can include: - Gold bullion (which can be gold bars or gold coins) - Gold jewelry - Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - Gold mining stocks - Gold futures and options - Digital gold If you have a mix of gold investments, it's important to decide which ones are worth selling and which ones are worth keeping. Compare your options for selling gold If you have physical gold, such as gold bars, coins or jewelry, you may want to find someone local to sell to, says Joshua Barone, wealth manager at Savvy Advisors. \"That way, you're not shipping a piece of high-valued metal through the mail to somebody that you don't know. You're actually going there in person and dealing with them face-to-face,\" says Barone. You can also check to see if the seller you purchased from offers a buyback program. If you do end up selling gold online, be sure to weigh your shipping and insurance policy options, Barone says. Before choosing a company, look at the reviews posted to the Better Business Bureau (BBB), Trustpilot and Google, as a key part of selling is working with a reputable company. \"Working with trustworthy specialty retailers, whether in person or through the internet, is the best approach,\" says Elliott. \"Market rates can vary slightly, but in general, you'll find that coin shops and bullion dealers who have a good reputation are going to offer the best prices and have the smoothest experience.\" For those with investments such as gold ETFs or gold stocks, the process may be more straightforward. \"It's just like selling any other stock through a broker. Buy low, sell high and enjoy the profit,\" says Elliott. Research prices and tax implications You should also take time to research current prices and make sure you're getting a fair deal. The potential tax implications of selling should be weighed, too. Gold investors should \"look at what they've earned in the process … how their portfolio looks and make a tax assessment before they make their decision to sell.\" Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, says. For example, you may be subject to capital gains tax, collectibles tax and other investment-related taxes depending on the type of gold and your income level. So, it's generally a good idea to discuss options with a tax professional who can help you with your particular situation. Sell gold safely and strategically After researching your options and doing your due diligence, you can move forward to selling gold for a profit. To protect yourself, though, you may want to take a few extra steps before parting with your gold. \"If you're sending stuff off, photograph the serial numbers, the assay marks, the hallmarks, all the stamps before you send it. Confirm the weight. You can check the weight and measure against what the mint, the refiner, actually produced,\" says Barone. If you're selling gold ETFs or gold stocks, go to your brokerage account to make the transaction and keep the confirmation for your records. The bottom line Thanks to today's record gold prices, now could be a good time to sell your gold for a profit. Just make sure you're also aware of potential downsides before making any moves. \"Selling now to lock in profits isn't a bad move. There are plenty of investors out there who have held on too long and missed their chance,\" says Elliott. \"But the odds seem good that gold has room to run, and selling now may be leaving money on the table.\" And, while selling can make sense, gold also has a unique place in your portfolio. In the current environment, it can make sense to continue adding to your holdings rather than selling. When you invest in gold, you have an asset that can help ride out market turbulence. \"Gold is a bastion of safety…and so my belief is that the long side is better than selling here,\" Barone says.",

    "title": "Under Kash Patel , the FBI personnel purge goes from bad to worse",
    "text": "Throughout Donald Trump’s second term, the FBI has been purging those deemed insufficiently loyal to the president and his agenda, but the campaign reached new depths last month. As part of an unsubtle revenge tour, three experienced bureau officials found themselves unemployed, including Brian Driscoll, a widely respected figure among rank-and-file agents who was fired after he helped prevent a mass firing of thousands of FBI officials who worked on Jan. 6 cases. Reporting on the chaos, MSNBC’s Ken Dilanian noted that the “purge that is ongoing is without precedent in the modern history of the bureau. It raises questions about whether the Trump administration is trying to turn the nation’s most powerful law enforcement agency into an instrument of presidential whim — exactly the thing he baselessly accused his opponent of doing.” A month later, the problem is still getting worse. NBC News reported: At least 15 FBI agents were fired Friday in connection with their actions during the protests that followed the death of George Floyd, a source familiar with the terminations told NBC News. The agents had been assigned to help secure federal buildings during the demonstrations, when a tense standoff developed between a large crowd of protesters and a limited number of FBI personnel. Some agents were photographed kneeling, which the source described as a tactic meant to de-escalate the conflict. The bureau has not yet explained why taking a knee in honor of a murder victim is a fireable offense. The FBI Agents Association, however, said in a statement that it “strongly” condemns the firings as “unlawful,” adding that the move violated “the due process rights of those who risk their lives to protect our country.” The same statement suggested Director Kash Patel’s personnel purge is illegal. “Leaders uphold the law — they don’t repeatedly break it. They respect due process, rather than hide from it,” the FBIAA said. “Patel’s dangerous new pattern of actions are weakening the Bureau because they eliminate valuable expertise and damage trust between leadership and the workforce, and make it harder to recruit and retain skilled agents — ultimately putting our nation at greater risk.” In case this isn’t obvious, Patel — an unqualified conspiracy theorist, who’s spent the year struggling with questions about whether he’s up to the job — testified during his confirmation hearings that he would never do what he keeps doing. “I have no interest, no desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards,” the then-nominee told senators. “There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by any FBI, should I be confirmed as the FBI director.” Months later, the director who had no interest in going “backwards” saw his FBI fire at least 15 agents who took a knee for George Floyd five years ago.

There’s so many people outside. Everybody’s cheering the soldiers, they’re cheering. Thank you so much, sir.” There was, of course, one small problem: The deployments in Memphis hadn’t happened yet. The quotes Trump shared were apparently concocted in his imagination, and he presented them as real. But as ridiculous as this was, much of the public was left to wonder which city might be next on the White House’s target list. We apparently didn’t have to wait too long to find out. NBC News reported: President Donald Trump said Saturday that he was directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ‘provide all necessary Troops’ to Portland, Oregon. In a post on Truth Social, the president wrote that the troops would ‘protect War ravaged Portland’ and protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities that he claimed are ‘under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists.’ As part of the same online missive, the Republican said he’s “authorizing Full Force, if necessary.” What did that mean, exactly? I’m not altogether sure, though it sounded as if the American president was authorizing the use of military force against Americans on American soil. It wasn’t the only area of uncertainty: There were also questions as to whether the president was sending National Guard or active-duty troops (or perhaps both), when this might happen, and whatever became of JD Vance’s recent assurances that Trump would never deploy troops to an American city without an invitation from state and local officials. For that matter, we don’t even know for sure whether there will be deployments: Trump claimed on Saturday that he was issuing a directive to the Pentagon, but it’s an open question as to whether he was just making this up. What’s more, one day after the presidential announcement, the state of Oregon and the city of Portland sued the administration in the hopes of derailing the deployments, and given the relevant details, the case stands a decent chance of success. But as important as these angles are, there’s a related question hanging overhead: Why Portland? The official line from Trump is that the city is “war ravaged” and “under siege,” making it necessary to use troops to protect local ICE facilities. The official line, however, is obvious nonsense. So what’s the real reason? As it turns out, the president recently hinted at the answer. While the White House has largely focused on Chicago and Baltimore, earlier this month the president raised the prospect of deploying the Guard to Portland because of something he’d seen on television the night before. The NBC affiliate in Portland highlighted some highly relevant comments Trump made to NBC News: Trump referenced a weekend conversation with Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, and he alluded to being told by Kotek that the reality in Portland is different from what’s being portrayed to him. ‘I spoke to the governor, she was very nice,’ Trump said. ‘But I said, “Well wait a minute, am I watching things on television that are different from what’s happening? My people tell me different.” They are literally attacking and there are fires all over the place...it looks like terrible.’ Oh. So Trump isn’t sure he’s right about Portland descending into a lawless hellscape, but he’s definitely seen some unsettling images while “watching things on television.” Are those “things” different from reality? The president apparently isn’t sure, which makes a terrible situation quite a bit worse.",

    "title": "Auction for Hudson Bay charter further delayed after late offer from unknown bidder",
    "text": "A surprise late-night bid that emerged Sunday for the 355-year-old royal charter that launched the Hudson’s Bay Co. has further delayed a legal process governing the auction of the historic document. A court hearing was held at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice Monday morning to approve a plan for the auction, which had been proposed for Oct. 15. But Hudson’s Bay received an unsolicited offer for the charter from an unidentified bidder at around 11 p.m. Sunday, lawyers told the court. The matter has been adjourned until Oct. 9. “There is some question about where it came from, how it was possible to bring it forward and how we can move forward in light of that bid,” said Ashley Taylor, a lawyer for the failed retailer, at the hearing. “It raises questions about what the best next steps are.” Editorial: The value, and values, of the HBC charter The 1670 charter has been the subject of significant discussion and concern among government officials, Indigenous leaders, historians and cultural groups since April, when The Globe and Mail first reported that the company was advertising the document to potential bidders among its assets for sale. “I must say I’m concerned, increasingly so, about the process,” Ontario Superior Court Justice Peter Osborne said during Monday’s hearing. “And I am going to keep this on the rails. The one thing, I think maybe the only thing, that all the parties agree on, is the importance and relevance of the royal charter to all Canadians and to various groups, including but not limited to certain Indigenous groups, who have expressed interest in this. So we are going to do this right, not fast.” The proposed sale of the parchment – which carries the wax seal of King Charles II and played a pivotal role in the history of Canada – is part of a months-long process to sell off the remaining assets of Canada’s oldest retailer. Facing a financial crisis and more than $1-billion in debt, Hudson’s Bay was granted court protection from its creditors on March 7 under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act. Unable to secure additional debt financing or find investors who would step forward to save even a handful of the stores, the department store chain closed all of its locations across Canada in early June. The charter had initially been intended for auction, but in July, the company instead sought court approval for a direct sale to the billionaire Weston family’s holding company, Wittington Investments Ltd. While the advisory firm overseeing the sale, Reflect Advisors LLC, had told potential buyers that it would not be accepting offers before that auction, Wittington came forward with a $12.5-million bid and a plan to donate the document to the Canadian Museum of History. Wittington urged the advisers not to hold the auction and offered an additional $1-million donation to the museum. That money was to support consultations with Indigenous groups and other concerned parties to determine how the charter should be presented and shared with other cultural institutions. Then, on Aug. 21, Canadian businessman David Thomson filed court documents signalling his interest in bidding at least $15-million for the charter with a plan to donate it to the Archives of Manitoba – which has held centuries of Hudson’s Bay records since the company donated its historical archives in 1994. The offer came from Mr. Thomson’s personal family holding company, DKRT Family Corp., and included a planned $2-million donation to fund consultations, as well as sharing the charter, if possible for its preservation. (The Woodbridge Co. Ltd., another holding company and primary investment vehicle for the Thomson family, owns The Globe.) Hudson’s Bay receives court approval to sell off six store leases for more than $5-million DKRT has signed a binding commitment letter to bid at least $15-million, according to the court documents filed earlier this month. Wittington was still considering whether it will participate in the auction, according to the most recent filings, which indicated that more bidders have also come forward to express their interest in buying the charter to donate it to Canadian public institutions. The adjournment faced no opposition Monday. But Matthew Lerner, a lawyer for some of the company’s senior lenders, suggested it was unusual. “We have some significant concerns about the circumstances leading to this late-breaking bid that we first heard about this morning around 8 a.m.,” he said. After Monday’s court hearing, Reflect co-founder and managing director Adam Zalev declined to comment on the identity of the newest bidder or explain why the bid required an adjournment rather than being considered at auction.",

    "title": "From Regattas to Red Carpets : Cumali Varer Journey to TV",
    "text": "For Lazuri Film founder Cumali Varer, everything flows back to the sea. Once a political prisoner and later a self-made seafarer, the Turkish-born Varer arrived in France as an exile in the late 1980s. Splitting his time between Paris, Istanbul and Cannes, he transformed the passions first sparked while fishing on the Black Sea into a life that carried him from sailor to one of the Mediterranean’s leading organizers of international regattas, and ultimately to producer, making a splash at Mipcom with “Korsan,” a nautical adventure series inspired as much by history as by the saltwater coursing through his own story. “I’ve spent my life on the sea, sailing and learning its rhythms,” Varer says. “Now I want to bring that world to the screen, telling stories that are universal but rooted in the region’s culture, courage, and beauty.” Popular on Variety Before founding Lazuri Film, Varer built cultural bridges through sailing, organizing international races across Spain, France, England, Turkey, Greece, and Italy. He honed his craft producing French-language documentaries for Turkish television, capturing Mediterranean life and sport along the way. At the same time, a chance encounter at a Paris embassy inspired a personal passion project: the story of Spain’s Jewish exiles, intercepted by Ottoman corsairs and given refuge in 15th-century Istanbul — a tale Varer has pursued with unwavering determination ever since. “This is a story of humanity and solidarity in a time of religious conflict and upheaval,” Varer says. “It speaks to enduring values of tolerance and cooperation, themes as urgent today as they were in the Mediterranean of the 15th century.” Varer first developed the idea independently before teaming with renowned French screenwriter and Luis Buñuel collaborator Jean-Claude Carrière. After Carrière’s passing in 2021, and navigating the shifting post-pandemic landscape, Varer reimagined the project as a series, enlisting “Barbarians” creator Andreas Heckmann. Under Heckmann’s lead, the script was transformed into a more action-driven, episodic story, weaving a central love triangle into a dynamic television drama. Acclaimed director Paul Wilmshurst, known for “The Last Kingdom” and “The Day of the Jackal,” has also come onboard. In 2022, Varer formally launched Lazuri Film to helm “Korsan.” He brought on ITV Studios veteran François Florentiny as strategic advisor, helping navigate distributor relations, shape marketing strategy, and assemble the production team, drawing on his extensive network across French audiovisual circles. The project is now ready to set sail. In advanced development and approaching pre-production, the script is complete, key crew members are on board, and Spanish locations have been scouted. Written in English, the series aims to cast top-tier actors in lead roles. Primarily a French production, it could expand into a French-Spanish co-production, with extensive filming in Granada and Cádiz and potential partners already in talks. The six-episode series carries a budget of $24 to $25 million, with net financing of $16 million-$17 million after rebates. A pre-sale deal with a major international distributor is in its final stages and expected to launch immediate pre-production, with filming planned in Spain in late summer 2026. Further on the horizon, Lazuri Film is developing “Groundtruth,” a high-stakes thriller exploring espionage, AI ethics, and global power struggles. Still in early development, the series is guided by Varer’s artistic vision, though his main focus remains on “Korsan.” “Telling this story today is about choice,” Varer says. “We can either fuel hatred or embrace coexistence. We live in a world full of fear, division and so-called clashes of civilizations. I have experienced exile and hardship, but this is not my personal story. It is universal; we all carry a past, a culture, a philosophy, and from that, a vision can emerge.” Varer also draws on his own experience to explain his approach to producing. “Organizing a regatta and producing a series follow the same principles,” he says. “You need passion, courage, preparation and the ability to bring people together around a vision. The skills I learned running international events — diplomacy, public relations, building cultural connections — now help me manage large-scale productions. It is about taking skills trained in one area and applying them in another.”",

    "title": "Walton Goggins Reacts to Pete Davidson Predicting Career Backlash",
    "text": "Walton Goggins is saying “fuck it” when it comes to social media potentially turning on him. “SNL” alum Pete Davidson recently made headlines for calling out the ways in which social media users often become obsessed with actors only to end up complaining about them a few months later. Davidson said it happened to Pedro Pascal, who went from the internet’s daddy to the subject of backlash for simply acting in a lot of popular stuff (from Marvel to “Star Wars” to “The Last of Us” to indie box office hit “Materialists” and more), and Davidson predicted it would happen to Goggins next. “Pete, we don’t know each other but I appreciate the heads up,” Goggins responded on Instagram. “We agree on one thing… Pedro Pascal isn’t a good man, He’s a great man. A dear friend of mine. As a 53 year old, I’m acutely aware that every experience has a shelf life. I appreciate so many of you going on this journey with me. I imagine a lot of you (and I don’t blame you) are tired of hearing my homilies. Trust me I’m tired of saying them. I have a few things coming out that I have an obligation to talk about… not for me mind you, but to honor all of those that worked so hard to bring these stories to fruition. So if you see something with my name on it I encourage you not to click on it… unless you want to… and if you do…I appreciate the support.” Popular on Variety While Goggins has been a beloved character actor for decades, he’s reached new levels of fame in recent months with acclaimed turns on blockbuster television series like “Fallout” and “The White Lotus.” The Emmy nominee said that he can’t be too mad about social media potentially turning on him when he’s fortunate to be in a position in his career where that would even be a chance. “How lucky am I that this is even a possibility?!!” Goggins wrote. “I’ve had the good fortune of engaging in so many interesting conversations with so many of you….of collaborating with so many top-shelf people across so many disciplines over the last couple of years. Way more than a poor kid from Georgia would ever have the audacity to imagine. I wouldn’t take one back. So… If saying yes in life more than saying no is a crime, then I’m guilty as charged. And If this headline is a possibility or an inevitability… if this is my fate… Well… Fuck it. I’m going to enjoy the FUCK OUT OF IT.” Davidson kickstarted discussion on this topic while appearing on Theo Von’s “This Past Weekend” podcast. He commented on how social media “can’t wait” to turn against entertainment figures they’ve previously loved. “Fucking two years ago he’s a hardworking, great actor,” Davidson said of Pascal’s reputation. “Everyone was like, ‘He’s worked so hard and has been a struggling actor.’ Fucking blows up so fucking hard. Everyone’s like, ‘Daddy, daddy! Yeah, daddy, daddy.’ Then a year later, he’s in everything now because he’s hot and big and everyone’s like, ‘Go the fuck away, dude.’” Davidson said later that social media is “going to do it with Walton Goggins next. … It’s, like, within months.”",

    "title": "Rupert Wyatt on  Desert Warrior  Delays :  I Was Sidelined  ",
    "text": "In September 2021, British director Rupert Wyatt (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”) started principal photography in the area around Saudi Arabia’s planned futuristic city of Neom on $150 million action epic “Desert Warrior,” touted as the country’s first Hollywood-style tentpole movie. Featuring a top-notch international cast led by “Captain America” star Anthony Mackie, Ben Kingsley and Aiysha Hart (“Mogul Mowgli,” “Colette”), the 7th-century Arabia-set film revolves around a princess (Hart) who refuses to serve as concubine to a ruthless emperor (Kingsley), prompting an epic showdown called the Battle of Ze Qar. Though production was completed by February 2022, “Desert Warrior’s” journey to the big screen was just beginning. The film — which is produced by Saudi-owned powerhouse MBC Studios with U.S. producer Jeremy Bolt (“Resident Evil”) and Stuart Ford’s AGC Studios — spent a long time in post-production hell after new MBC management decided to take Wyatt off the picture. As the years rolled on, some deemed it a train wreck that might never make it to the big screen after all. Popular on Variety “There was a desire to start to change the movie. And it wasn’t really the movie that I had set out to make, nor had I shot,” Wyatt tells Variety. “And so I resisted, and I was sidelined. I was sidelined for a good period.” However, Wyatt was eventually reinstated and his “Desert Warrior” cut bowed this weekend at the Zurich Film Festival. Despite mixed reviews, the film debuted to unanimous praise for its stellar production value, thus doing away with any train wreck connotations — which the director says stemmed from “a certain disdain” due to the fact that “we weren’t Hollywood” and “we had a lot of money.” Below, Wyatt speaks to Variety about the long journey to get “Desert Warrior” on the big screen and why, despite all the challenges, he’s “still pushing for a success.” How did this project come your way? I met Jeremy Bolt, the producer, a couple of years before we started on this. We were developing a project together which never came to fruition. A long time work colleague of his, Pete Smith, who ran MBC Studios at the time, had decided to develop this project and I was asked to come on board. What attracted you to “Desert Warrior” from the outset? It’s a very important story for the region. It’s kind of their [Battle of] Agincourt. They had this notion that they were going to embark on this very ambitious epic, primarily centered around the character of Princess Hind. From my perspective, I saw an incredible opportunity. I mean, I’ve long been fascinated by the region, the culture, the Bedouin culture. I love the desert. It’s a hidden period of history, the seventh century, I knew very little about. The Sassanid Empire was something I was fascinated by. When Jeremy approached me, it became clear that there was an opportunity to make something very much in-camera [not heavy on special effects and studio work] because of the nature of how we were going to make it and who we were going to make it with — it was outside of Hollywood. So I jumped at the chance, but on the proviso that I could sort of really make it my own. What type of challenges did “Desert Warrior” pose? We started scouting and then COVID-19 hit. So initially, we were beset with a lot of delays. We were going to go into production in 2020, and then that was pushed a few months. But in an interesting way, it gave us an amazing opportunity to really get into the region and get a better sense of how to work there and how to make a film there. Because it was all from the ground up. That was really one of the biggest challenges, I would say. I mean, there were many challenges. From a storytelling perspective the challenge was really just trying to embrace a film of this size and be able to sort of wrestle its emotional core into place. That’s always a challenge, but with this one it was in particular. Let’s talk about the shoot in Neom and Tabuk. This film certainly breaks new ground for the nascent Saudi industry. Did the fact that that Saudi Arabia is somewhat on a learning curve impact the physical production? Not from my perspective. I mean, we had about 600 people, including drivers — not including cast or extras — but literally a crew of 600+ with us, under one roof in the middle of the desert for several months. And a lot of that crew were from the region. We had Jordanian, we had Lebanese, we had Syrian, we had everyone from across the Arabic diaspora. And then we had Canadian, Italian, Serbian, American, English, Australian, South African. So it was 40+ nationalities. It’s easy to sort of say, “Hollywood comes to town.” But it wasn’t quite like that, because we weren’t Hollywood. We were a very international bunch of filmmakers with many different backgrounds and cultural influences. And one of the things that I found — and I say this genuinely — is that the experience of making a film in that region was quite profoundly inspiring. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that we it was a brand new experience for so many of us to to make a film from the ground up. We had, logistically, very little support. We were out there on our own. It was like making your first film on an extraordinary scale, because we had to make choices that normally are made by people in back rooms. For us, it was very much like sink or swim. You were taken off the final edit, and then brought back on. Can you talk to me about that experience? What I can say is this. The making of this film from Day One — other than the challenges posed by COVID — is one of the best filmmaking experiences I’ve ever had. Creatively, it was incredibly harmonious. Logistically, immensely challenging, but ultimately successful. We were about four days over schedule by the time we wrapped, which, for a film of this size, is a real achievement. And that wasn’t me, that was actually primarily Eric Hedayat, my line producer, and Jeremy, the producer. They were incredibly tenacious and they really kept everything on on track. So when we came away from the the end of our main shoot, we were we were in a great place. We had over 300 hours of dailies, which is about equivalent to “Mad Max: Fury Road.” I say this with respect, but also with the experience of being a filmmaker and having done this before: There was a little bit of naivety from the studio. They were very supportive, but the notion of being able to cut a film of this entity in 10 weeks is just impossible. I mean, I was always sort of referring to “Mad Max” in my mind. That took over 12 months before they had a version of the movie. So we went to work, and after about six or seven months, they gave me two or three extra months to get the cut in place. Then I flew to Dubai, showed it to the suits, and it was met with a really positive reaction. We were given the green light for one week of additional shooting. We had not shot a key scene, the leper colony scene, because of a sandstorm. So we were given the green light to go back and do that and do some pickups. At that time, there was a changing of the guard at MBC, and that’s when things changed for me. There was a desire to start to change the movie. And it wasn’t really the movie that I had set out to make, nor had I shot. And so I resisted, and I was sidelined. I was sidelined for a good period. The film was then recut without my input. It’s been misreported that my version of the film was tested; it never was. I had a two-hour-and 20-minute cut that I was very happy with. Everyone seemed to be happy with it. And that film was recut and it was tested, and I don’t think it went very well. Long story short, they asked me to come back, and they asked me to come back on the proviso that I bring it down to a certain length [“Desert Warrior” is now 1 hour and 54 minutes]. And my proviso was that I would have creative control to do so. The sadness for me is that up until that point, we’d done well. We’d done the very best that we could. We were not in conflict, creatively, logistically, financially. We had not gone over budget. There was this notion that we were making a film for $70 million, which was never the case with COVID overruns and stuff. COVID itself put $20 million on our budget. So we never ballooned over budget. We never had chaotic or numerous reshoots or anything like that. It was just this period of time where I was not involved in the film and they looked to recut it. Ultimately, when I did come back, my one request was that I would have creative control. And provided I came in at this length, I was fully supported. So that’s what we did. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",

    "title": "ABC Picks Up Scott Speedman Pilot  RJ Decker  To Series For Midseason",
    "text": "ABC has given a series order to hourlong pilot RJ Decker (working title), starring Scott Speedman, for the current 2025-26 season. The project, from Elementary creator Rob Doherty based on the 1987 novel Double Whammy by Carl Hiaasen, will premiere in midseason. In addition to Speedman in the titular role, RJ Decker stars Kevin Rankin as Aloysius “Wish” Aiken, Adelaide Clemens as Catherine Delacroix and Bevin Bru as Melody “Mel” Romero. The series-regular role of Shay Bennett, played by Weruche Opia in the pilot, will be recast. Delivered to the network earlier this month, the pilot, from 20th Television, was well received with Speedman’s performance getting high marks. In mixing crime procedural drama with humor and a compelling lead character, RJ Decker fits into ABC’s sweet spot of hits like High Potential, The Rookie and Will Trent. Reinforcing the spiritual connection, Paul McGuigan, who directed the Will Trent pilot, was also brought in to helm the RJ Decker pilot. RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Watch on Deadline Written by Doherty, the series centers on RJ Decker (Speedman), is a disgraced newspaper photographer and ex-con who starts over as a private investigator in the colorful-if-crime-filled world of South Florida. The series follows him tackle cases that range from slightly odd to outright bizarre with the help of his journalist ex, her police detective wife, and a shadowy new benefactor, a woman from his past who could be his greatest ally… or his one-way ticket back to prison. The pilot was shot in North Carolina, the filming location for the series is TBD. Doherty executive produces alongside Hiaasen, Carl Beverly, Sarah Timberman and McGuigan, with Speedman serving as a producer. 20th Television, a part of Disney TV Studios, is the studio. Speedman also has been recurring on 20th TV’s long-running ABC medical drama Grey’s Anatomy. This is the second TV series based on the works of Florida native Hiaasen, who started his career as a newspaper reporter, joining Bill Lawrence’s Bad Monkey starring Vince Vaughn for Apple TV+, which has been renewed for a second season. RJ Decker is the only drama pilot ordered by ABC so far this year. (The network’s new fall 2025 drama, 9-1-1: Nashville, received a straight-to-series order.) Waiting in the wings is The Rookie spinoff The Rookie North, which has not been formally greenlighted yet, with creator Alexi Hawley looking at a late-winter pilot shoot. ABC and 20th TV brass are taking their time casting the lead, looking to take a page from the RJ Decker (and The Rookie) playbook by landing a TV star of the caliber of Speedman and Nathan Fillion for The Rookie offshoot. On the comedy side, ABC recently gave a straight-to-series order to the Scrubs reboot and picked up to pilot the Rachel Bloom starrer Do You Want Kids?. That pilot is also expected to take its time finding the male lead opposite Bloom; it’s targeted for 2026-27 season. The network’s other comedy prospect, Mittens, which revolves around a neighborhood cat, will be in consideration for the next pilot cycle.",

    "title": "Distributor Filmhub Pacts With Evan Shapiro On Creator - Led  SKIT , With Comedy Bowing On Tubi",
    "text": "Distribution company Filmhub has secured worldwide rights to creator-led comedy SKIT via a partnership with producer and former TV exec Evan Shapiro. The film, which was made for just $65,000, will also debut on Tubi on November 14, in a 30-day streaming window before the sales window formally opens. Filmhub, a new-model distribution outfit founded in 2016, will feature SKIT in its slate at MIPCOM later this fall as this year’s confab spotlights the creator economy. Shapiro, who ran IFC, Sundance Channel and Pivot during a lengthy run as a cable TV exec before hanging out his production shingle ESHAP, is an executive producer of SKIT. Set in 2007, at the dawn of user-generated content, the film follows three female college students determined to make a viral YouTube video. Detailing that journey, the film incorporates cameos by a number of recognizable internet personalities. Watch on Deadline SKIT’s ensemble cast features Jamie Linn Watson, Nataly Aukar, Jamie Shapiro, Alise Morales, Lukas Arnold and Jacob Kaplan, with cameos by Jim O’Heir (Parks and Rec) and Mary Birdsong (Reno 911). The comedy was created, co-written and directed by Des Lombardo (who shot the film in his family home) alongside co-writer and director Badr Mastrouq. In addition to a starring role, Jamie Shapiro is a producer alongside Paul Bukoskey. “The creator economy has opened the door for independent voices to find homes on the same platforms as traditional entertainment,” said Shapiro, who has also carved out a niche as a self-described “media cartographer” and consultant. “The next stage of the entertainment industry’s revolution is the ‘affinity economy’ where success isn’t just about scale, it’s about depth. True power lies in creators connecting directly with communities, sparking emotion and passion and SKIT is a perfect case study in this shift.” Filmhub co-founder and CEO Alan d’Escragnolle said the project coincides with his company’s strategic expansion from traditional film and TV to more creator-led content. In making that move, he said, “there’s no better creative partner than Evan and ESHAP to help chart the course. At Filmhub, we focus on supporting storytellers by ensuring that films like SKIT not only get made but also reach the audiences they were created for.” Tubi has likewise tapped the creator economy with projects like Sidelined: The QB and Me, with social media buzz helping the film pull in more viewers in its first seven days than any other Tubi original. The streaming service earlier this year put a sequel in development. Tubi also last summer launched a major creator initiative, Tubi for Creators, installing Vimeo alum Rich Bloom as GM of creator programs and EVP of business development. “We’re excited to partner with Filmhub and Evan Shapiro to bring SKIT to our Tubi audience of 100 million monthly active users,” Bloom said. “Tubi for Creators is designed to support independent storytellers – giving them creative freedom and the scale to expand their audiences. Tubi offers a platform where bold, breakthrough work can live alongside iconic movies and TV, making it the ideal home for SKIT.”",

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. To fix Alexa, Amazon had to break it apart and rebuild it. The result is a hybrid smart home assistant, personal assistant, and Amazon’s answer to ChatGPT. Right now, in its Beta phase, this new Alexa isn’t doing any of those things as well as I’d hoped. This is most obvious in the smart home. Controlling my lights, locks, and robot vacuum with natural language rather than precise phrases is a huge improvement, as is not having to say “Alexa” repeatedly and being able to interrupt, um and er, and change my mind mid-thought. But we are still far from the dream of the ambient home that runs on a Star Trek–style “Computer.” Today, running on what feels like underpowered hardware and with surface-level integrations into my smart home, Alexa Plus often leaves me frustrated. There’s power under that hood, but it feels largely inaccessible. The assistant desperately needs something to make it more compelling — and better hardware could be the answer. Alexa Plus should make the smart home smarter Generative AI is supposed to be a watershed moment for the smart home. By cutting through the complexity of programming your home and removing the frustrations of clunky commands, LLMs should make the smart home more accessible. And in many ways, Alexa Plus delivers. I can now say, “Alexa, dim the lights in here, adjust the thermostat down a few degrees, lock the front door, and turn the upstairs lights off. Oh, and remind me to take the trash out in the morning,” and it all happens. This kind of easy, hands-free convenience is exactly what the smart home has promised for years. Managing my devices is also simpler. Instead of scrolling through thumbnail clips in the Ring app, I can ask an Echo Show 21 when the cat was last on the porch and instantly see a full-screen video. The updated UI on the Show 15 and 21 is a big improvement, with larger widgets, customizable layouts, and easier access to smart home controls. Recently, Alexa and I chatted about the best ways to use my smart home gadgets to their full potential. It suggested possible routines, built the automations, tweaked them based on my feedback, and tested them — all in minutes, with no fiddling in the (still clunky) Alexa app. It even helped me set up a new air purifier and folded it into one of those routines. But there are issues. Alexa Plus is noticeably slower, with some requests taking up to 15 seconds for a response. While turning on lights or adjusting a thermostat is fast enough (I assume due to using local connections over Matter), waiting for over 10 seconds for the weather or a song to play is tiresome. Some basic features that used to work reliably now don’t or require new phrasing every time. My struggles to control my Alexa-enabled coffee machine persist, and I can’t get Alexa to consistently turn on my bathroom fan for a set period of time. I used to say, “Turn on the bathroom fan for 15 minutes,” and it did it. Now, Alexa Plus tells me it has to create a routine to do that, and then doesn’t run that routine. Or it says, “Sure,” turns the fan on, but never turns it off. I’ve tried this a dozen times and haven’t had a consistent response yet. One surreal moment: after weeks of Alexa Plus’ new voice, the old Alexa suddenly surfaced when the system hit a snag. “Sorry, something went wrong,” it said in that stiff, familiar tone. For a second, I wondered — is the old Alexa still in there, trying to get out? Building the old on top of the new The old Alexa — the deterministic model built on rigid command-and-control rules — is essentially gone. According to Panos Panay, head of Amazon’s devices and service division, whom I spoke with in February, Alexa Plus runs on an entirely new architecture. One that, based on my testing, feels much more powerful than the old Alexa, but also less reliable. That’s the paradox of LLMs: they’re excellent at parsing human language, but they’re not designed for consistency. Ask ChatGPT the same question twice, and you’ll get different answers. The unpredictability of LLMs, known as nondeterminism, is a poor fit for smart home control, where reliability and repeatability are crucial. It’s great when you’re brainstorming, but frustrating when you just want your morning coffee. Amazon’s workaround has been to use its LLM models as a kind of translator. It interprets what you say, then hands off the request to deterministic systems — APIs, device controllers, or local Matter connections. The unpredictability of LLMs is a poor fit for smart home control, where reliability and repeatability are crucial. I’ve found this works most of the time, but if the LLM translates a request incorrectly or there’s a gap in the API, it appears that handoff can fail. I assume that’s why my bathroom fan sometimes turns on as requested and why Alexa sometimes insists on creating a routine but then forgets to finish the job. This is the problem every company with a voice assistant in the smart home is dealing with — merging the old and predictable with the new and exciting. LLMs aren’t designed to be predictable, and what you want when controlling your home is predictability. Panay says they’ve worked hard to bring predictability to Alexa Plus and to ensure it won’t hallucinate in your smart home. While the former still needs work, so far my smart home has been hallucination-free. There have been no bizarre behaviors such as unlocking doors or cranking up the heat unbidden, or doing something different from what was requested. However, this tightly controlled structure has resulted in an Alexa Plus that is not the paradigm shift I was hoping for. Of course, it’s still early days, but the promise of LLMs is that they will unlock the potential of technology within our homes — and that hasn’t happened yet. Alexa Plus hasn’t changed anything for me; it’s just made my smart home (mostly) easier to manage. It still feels like pieces and parts, not a cohesive whole being run by an intelligent machine. Hardware could hold the key Many of my frustrations with Alexa Plus are connected to the hardware, and changes here could make a big difference. The current Show devices are the flagship Alexa Plus interfaces, specifically the Show 21 and 15. But the interplay between voice and screen is still lacking; the hardware remains voice-first. For example, I’ll ask Alexa to show me the recipe I was just using, and instead, it will read out the directions. With hardware that synchronizes voice and visuals seamlessly, Alexa Plus would be very compelling. (Also, the Shows are the worst Echo devices at hearing commands, and Amazon really needs to fix that.) Andy Jassy has promised us “beautiful” new hardware for Alexa. As the first products fully designed under Panos Panay, who told me he believes in screens, we have some idea of what’s coming. But ultimately, it will be about how well the hardware and software work together. The devices revealed this week will be Alexa Plus’s moment to prove it’s more than just potential.

    "title": "OpenAI ChatGPT parental controls are rolling out here what you should know",
    "text": "OpenAI has rolled out some long-awaited parental controls for ChatGPT to all web users, with mobile coming “soon,” according to the company. OpenAI’s ChatGPT parental controls are rolling out — here’s what you should know Parents must have their own accounts to access the controls, and teens must opt in. Parents must have their own accounts to access the controls, and teens must opt in. The controls, announced last month, allow for reducing or removing certain content — like sexual roleplay and the ability to generate images — and reducing the level of personalization on ChatGPT conversations by turning off its memory of past transcripts. Parents must have their own accounts to access the controls, and teens must opt in, either by inviting a parent to link their account or by accepting a parent’s invitation. Teens can disconnect their accounts at any time, though parents will be notified if that happens. Parents don’t have access to their teens’ conversations, even with a linked account. The only potential exception: “in rare cases where our system and trained reviewers detect possible signs of serious safety risk, parents may be notified — but only with the information needed to support their teen’s safety,” per OpenAI. Once the controls are set up, here are the new adjustments parents will be able to make for teen accounts, according to the company’s blog post and announcement thread. There’s also a parent resource page available. - Reduce sensitive content: Parents can add additional protections like reducing “graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay and extreme beauty ideals,” per OpenAI, and the setting is on by default for teen accounts once they’re linked to a parent’s account. - Turn off ChatGPT’s memory of past chats: Turning this off allows for less personalization and potentially better-working guardrails. In a blog post last month, for instance, OpenAI noted ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline the first time someone makes a concerning comment — but “after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards.” - Turn off OpenAI’s own models training on a teen’s chats: Parents can control whether their teen’s past transcripts and files “can be used to improve our models,” per OpenAI. - Turn on “quiet hours”: Parents will be able to set times when their teen won’t have access to ChatGPT. - Turn off voice mode: Teens will only be able to converse with ChatGPT in text form. - Turn off image generation: If this is turned off, the teen won’t be able to create or edit images using ChatGPT. - Choose a notification method: Parents can get alerts if something concerning happens via email, SMS, push notification, or all three — or they can opt out of such notifications. OpenAI laid out most of these features back in August when it said parental controls were coming. Notably, one feature that it was “exploring” seems to have not materialized: the ability to set an emergency contact who is reachable with “one-click messages or calls” within the chatbot. It’s possible OpenAI hopes to cover some of the same ground with the automatic feature for notifying parents. “We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we’ve built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,” OpenAI wrote. OpenAI’s original announcement came after the death of Adam Raine, the 16-year-old who died by suicide after months of confiding in ChatGPT. OpenAI was hit with a lawsuit, and within weeks, ChatGPT was being discussed during a Senate panel about various chatbots’ potential harm to minors, where parents of teens who died by suicide spoke. Hours before the Senate panel, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a blog in which he said the company was attempting to balance teen safety with both privacy and freedom, and that the company is working on an “age-prediction system to estimate age based on how people use ChatGPT.” Matthew Raine, the father of the late Adam, said during the Senate panel hearing earlier this month, “As parents, you cannot imagine what it’s like to read a conversation with a chatbot that groomed your child to take his own life. What began as a homework helper gradually turned itself into a confidant and then a suicide coach.” During the hearing, Raine also criticized OpenAI’s past approach to safety. “On the very day that Adam died, Sam Altman … made their philosophy crystal-clear in a public talk,” Raine said, going on to add that Altman said OpenAI should “‘deploy AI systems to the world and get feedback while the stakes are relatively low.’” If you or someone you know is considering suicide or is anxious, depressed, upset, or needs to talk, there are people who want to help.

    "text": "Hello, and welcome to Decoder! This is Nilay Patel’s show about big ideas and other problems. I am not Nilay Patel, though I have long wanted to be him. Ford CEO Jim Farley on China, tariffs, and the quest for a $30,000 EV Guest host Joanna Stern and the head of Ford discuss Apple CarPlay Ultra, competing with BYD, and what car she should lease next. Ford CEO Jim Farley on China, tariffs, and the quest for a $30,000 EV Guest host Joanna Stern and the head of Ford discuss Apple CarPlay Ultra, competing with BYD, and what car she should lease next. I am Joanna Stern, the senior personal technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, author of the upcoming book I AM NOT A ROBOT (releasing spring 2026), and, once upon a time, a cofounder of The Verge. I’m the last Monday guest host filling in for Nilay while he’s out on parental leave with his adorable new son, and I’m very excited to be talking today to Ford CEO Jim Farley. I’m a longtime Decoder listener and my favorite episodes are car episodes. I might not own a gas-powered Mustang convertible like Nilay — I’m not cool enough — but I did, in fact, lease my first EV, a Ford Mustang Mach-E, back in 2023. I think car CEOs are currently facing some of the most fascinating and complex challenges in both tech and business. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! So when I was asked to guest host the show I said, “That’s it, car CEOs.” And Jim was at the top of the list. Jim was on this show once before — his first appearance was in May 2021. And, well, a whole lot has changed in the past four years. Actually, a whole lot has changed in the last four months. The second Trump administration’s barrage of tariffs, trade wars, and a whole lot more, just to name a few. For Ford, it’s an especially critical moment. Last month, the company announced what it calls the Ford Universal EV Platform, an all-new manufacturing process that the company is calling a “Model T moment” for EVs. That’s because it should, in theory, allow Ford to produce cheaper EVs in a more efficient manner than it does with its current lineup, including my Mach-E. You will hear Jim say “last week” a few times — that’s because we taped this episode in August just after their announcement. It’s also not just tariff troubles for Ford. There’s the general weakening of demand for EVs in the US, the loss of the federal tax credit, and rising competition from low-cost Chinese competitors like BYD and Xiaomi. One thing I love about talking to Jim is that he’s honest about it all. You’ll hear him say in plain terms that China is, in some respects, miles ahead of the West when it comes to some parts of its EV industry. And this major multibillion-dollar gamble on a Ford Universal EV Platform isn’t a done deal. You’re going to hear him say the word “risk” quite a lot in this conversation, and how this major manufacturing and strategy pivot could very well fail. Jim had quite a lot to say about rebuilding the manufacturing base of blue-collar workers here in the US to compete with China — and even AI. Plus, he didn’t shy away from what he’d like to see from the Trump administration on tariffs. He says specifically, “We’re just asking for a fair fight.” And don’t worry, I didn’t forget to do my best Nilay impression with a bunch of Decoder questions. Is Ford considering Apple’s CarPlay Ultra? (His answer is so great on that one.) How does Jim Farley make decisions? And, most importantly, do I stick with the Ford Mach-E when my lease is up next summer? I also couldn’t let Jim go without hitting him with a special call-in question from an old friend who’s technically not supposed to be working right now. I think you’re going to really like that one. Okay, hopefully you’re in your car listening to this: Ford CEO Jim Farley, here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Jim Farley, you are the CEO of Ford Motor Company. Welcome back to Decoder. Great to be here with you, Joanna. Thank you for coming on my show. Obviously, this is not my show, this is Nilay’s show, but I want to give you some background. I listen to Decoder all the time, and I love Nilay’s car CEO interviews. But often I find myself saying, “Nilay, why didn’t you ask that question?” So, when he asked me to do this, I said, “That’s it, I’m going to bring on car CEOs. And I’m going to ask the questions I want.” I see. [Laughs] So you were last on the show in May 2021. Things have changed considerably in the world, in technology, in the country, and at Ford. I want to talk about all of those things. But something also changed for me. In 2023, I got a Mustang Mach-E. I leased one. Thank you. And that lease is up next summer. Ah, I’ll be reading about your decision process. Well, that’s going to inform a lot of this conversation because I wanted to give you the chance to be the world’s best car salesman to the most annoying customer. I think that’s just going to set a lot of the backdrop of this conversation. [Laughs] I love it. Last month, you said at a press conference that the Mach-E is not so great, that it’s not the future of Ford. Why should I stick with a Ford EV next time? Well, we just won the revised Model Y versus Mach-E drive evaluation by a pretty respected magazine. I’m still pretty proud of the Mach-E. We knew what we knew then (five years ago) and we now know what we know now. Those are, as you said, two different things. I would say that in the second inning of product development, Ford really understood the opportunity to serve the EV market more fully than we did several years ago and we executed a product with the right approach based on those lessons. That’s with the consumer, because we’ve learned what consumers are willing to live with and not — like charging on the fly — as well as where in the market Ford should participate and put its limited resources. I think you’re going to find that the Ford EV product range will be much sharper, more specific, and more valuable to customers than it was when you last shopped. Let’s dig into the news you just announced, which is that you have something called Ford Universal EV Platform. What is that, and when is it coming? More specifically for me, will it be out next August, and will I be able to get that kind of new Ford versus an upgrade to my Mach-E? You’ll learn a lot more about the first product. It’s a platform that will be out in 2027. We learned so much from the Mach-E. We’ve been number two to Tesla. We’re a long way behind them, but we’re number two in the US market in EV sales. EV sales aren’t the most important metric, but it does give you an indication that Ford has learned a lot and has served a lot of wonderful customers like you. We have all of the data coming off the vehicle, so we have learned a lot about customers. We believe the platform that we shared in Kentucky is a breakthrough approach for developing and delivering an affordable, electric platform to customers, where we’ll develop and launch several vehicles over the subsequent few years and show that we can have a profitable vehicle that’s sustainable in terms of the company’s resources and made in the US. But in order to compete with the likes of BYD, who we think are among the best in the world, we had to completely reinvent the platform for the customers. There’s a lot to that. I’m sure we’ll get into it, but in short, the evolution revolution of our thinking was to develop a vehicle for manufacturability, to radically reduce the cost and the complexity of the vehicle with all new thinking that is not embedded in a traditional car company. To do that, we needed all new talent, and we needed them to be separate from Ford, separate from our IT solutions that we used to develop and release parts, and separate from a philosophy standpoint about how to radically simplify the vehicle. This is all to really get back to the basics of Ford and Henry Ford’s idea of a “universal car.” Our first body style will be a pickup, but it’s really not a pickup. I would say it’s a new silhouette. What I mean by that is that it has more room than a RAV4, the best-selling passenger car in the US. That doesn’t include its frunk and pickup truck bed. It is very fast, it’s rear-wheel drive, it’s super fun to drive, and it has a digital experience that no one’s seen — at least that we’ve seen — even in China. The digital experience is quite different for customers. I think the whole package is something that has not been offered in the US or anywhere else to date. I think this first product is quite revolutionary. And this first product is what you’re going to have out in 2027? Yes, exactly. You’ve mentioned BYD, which is a Chinese competitor that is making low-cost, very high-tech EVs. Here in the US, you’re up against Tesla and GM. You mentioned that you have the second-best-selling EV, but GM seems to have had some real luck with the Equinox EVs, and they’re quickly taking off because of price. Absolutely. Is the move to put this new platform out against this backdrop enough? Is it enough to compete both here and in China? For us, it could be. Globally, no,, it’s not enough. In North America, it’s absolutely the right strategy, but it’s not our complete strategy. GM has 14 nameplates, we have three. We came out with our vehicles four or five years ago, and it’s coming out with them now. So, our product cycle is completely different. What I mean by that is we’re about to launch our second generation of products, and it has its first 14 out now. I hope it outsells us. If I were GM with 14 nameplates, it should easily scale. I personally didn’t think we would be number two for three years with our simple lineup, but it seems to have worked so far in the first inning. The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry. There’s no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we’ve seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China. They have 20 million units locally, and about 11 million are EV or [extended-range EVs], So half that market. We’re barely at a million vehicles here in the US. That’s one tenth of China’s volume. Europe’s only twice as big as us, so that’s maybe only one fifth. China’s successful for good reason. It has great innovation at a very low cost. For example, it bet on [lithium iron phosphate] technology, not these expensive lithium batteries. There’s hundreds of companies, and they’re all sponsored by their local governments, so they have huge subsidies. It’s new brands. It’s BYD and Geely, and companies like Nio and Xiaomi, many of which have never been in the car business before, and that’s a big advantage for them. In China, the brands that are winning are indigenous brands. They’re not global automotive companies, they’re really Chinese companies. To beat them, we need a completely different approach. It’s not the number of vehicles you have or the price you offer the customer. Everyone’s going to have affordable EVs. If you sell an affordable EV in the US for $30,000 but it costs you $50,000 to make, you could say you have an affordable EV, but that’s not a sustainable business. Three or four years ago, we saw this affordable customer duty cycle changing with our sales. It became very obvious to me that we had to go outside of Ford, create this maverick group, give them resources and stay out of their way, but make sure that they deliver on a completely new approach because the Chinese are so formidable, they have so much support from the government, and their customers have such a high expectation for the digital experience that an incremental approach from Mach-E would never work. I love you telling it to me real straight here. It’s exactly what I was thinking. In some ways I’m driving a dinosaur, right? That’s the whole reason I leased a number of years back. Smart move. I want to go back to price. I was charging at an Electrify America station in Connecticut recently, and four out of the six stalls had these Chevy Equinox EVs. I asked this woman how she likes hers. She said she liked it, but the thing she was really talking about was the price. She said, “We like this car and the price so much that we actually got two.” And she pointed to her husband who’s in the other stall. I’m not thrilled that this type of family’s taking up all these stalls, but it’s fine. I forgive them. I’m wondering if just getting that price down so that EVs can finally take off in lower, more affordable areas is one of your motivating factors right now. To your point, I think it was inevitable that government support would wane. It was inevitable that the duty cycle wound up being EV customers who use their car for commuting and shorter trips, and occasionally taking a longer trip. This happened in the 1910s over 100 years ago. Steam was 30 percent, electric was 30 percent, and the rest was internal combustion engines. A few years later, it was totally different. Back then you could not call which technology would win. It’s the same now. The EVs came at the high end, and I would say $40,000 is expensive now for most people. We don’t talk about it in the car business because more than two-thirds of the cars sold in the US are used. We never really talk about those two-thirds, but their average price is around $30,000. The average new car is obviously much higher than that. Most of the five-year-old vehicles that people are driving around in the US are going to be around $30,000. This is the most important part of the EV market. It’s not expensive Lucids and Teslas. That’s all interesting, but what is really going to move this market is a non-government-subsidized, affordable EV that people can afford, and that’s at a lower cost to use than a used Model Y because there’s a lot of those around. For people in America who have a tough time with all their demands, want to go on vacation, want to put their kids through college, and want to have a house or whatever, $30,000 is the most they want to spend. I think that customer you met is very typical. Sorry to use a baseball analogy, but this next inning is completely different from the first one, where the fitness of the companies doesn’t rely on the government, and we have to innovate. I said it last week, and I’ll emphasize it now: there are no assurances that we can do this. No one has ever built a car in three pieces. No one’s offered their own electric architecture at this price. We’ve never done it. We’ve never had two large unit castings and high quality. No one’s done it. Tesla’s talked about it, but it hasn’t done it. In fact, our manufacturing process has radically moved on beyond what Tesla’s ever shown in its unboxing. So, there’s a lot of risk here. This is not a guarantee that Ford’s going to get this done. You’ve segued really nicely into my next set of questions, which are the Decoder questions. You’ve set out to build something, and now you’ve got to figure out the structure to build it. You said you had to create a maverick group that was separate from Ford, separate in terms of IT. Now, you’ve got to take this skunkworks engineering team, which I believe is in California, and you’ve got to bring that into the big castle that is Ford. Yes. How do you think about integrating these new skunkworks ideas into this bigger system? Have you mapped out how that’s going to happen? Yes. We’ve been working on that for a couple years now. One of the things that really helped us in that regard was that Alan [Clarke], the leader of this Universal EV Platform team, was free to have Ford people on his team but had the right to say no to anyone. So, he went through a very rigorous process. He’s had the team that scouts for the manufacturing process for all this new stuff for three to four years.Of course, we’ve been listening to them. We have a lot of good experience at Ford, too, that knows how to handle risk in supply chain and risk in manufacturing and new processes like the one we use with aluminum F-150. It’s a different problem, but the same process of risk elimination. It’s a plan that has come together. It’s important to have a plan, but you get out of the plan pretty quickly because of surprises. The supplier isn’t as good as you thought, they’re running late, or software for a module is running late. Then, you have to really de-risk. The way we’re thinking about it is, “Let’s make a simple one first. Let’s not try to add all the complexity. Why don’t we just make one color, one version, one spec at the beginning, and massively simplify the task for everyone? What is the basic level of software capability?” We don’t need all the singing and dancing, hands-free automation at launch. Maybe we focus BlueCruise on a simple operating domain like high-speed safety, with hands-off highway operations for the autonomy solution. Then gradually, as we verify the delivery of that base capability — whether it’s the vehicle structure, the manufacturing process of the suppliers, or even automation — we start to introduce more complexity and capability over time when we feel comfortable. That makes it stressful for the go-to-market team because, frankly, they don’t know what they’re going to be selling in a year and a half. But that’s the only way we’ve found to do this. I want to stay on some more Decoder questions, and call you out. In your first Decoder interview in 2021, you dodged the question, “How do you make decisions?” In fact, I was listening to the episode in my Mach-E last week and just screaming, “Jim, you didn’t answer.” You answered about the company’s strategy, but you didn’t answer how you specifically make decisions. I feel like you’ve had to make some big decisions here with this new platform. So, how do you do it? Let’s just be specific. In this case, I looked at the wiring loom in the Mach-E. It’s a beautiful wiring loom, but it’s 70 pounds heavier than the Model Y’s wiring loom, and it’s $200 a battery to carry that wiring loom around. I just had to ask myself the question, “Can my team do it?” Taking the wiring loom as a metaphor, can my team beat BYD? I went to [Executive Chairman] Bill Ford, the board, and my team. I said, “I love you guys, but I don’t think we can do this.” The decision I arrived at, which was highly informed by meeting Doug Fields, was that we had to do it completely separately. Doug is a Model 3 chief engineer and worked on the car project at Apple. He was one of the first-generation software designers in AOS. He also designed the Segway early in his career. He’s been at the forefront of a lot of technology revolutions time and time again. I asked him, “Why can’t Ford do it?” He’s like, “Jim, your part release system, your IT, your CAD design systems are 25 years uncompetitive. There’s no way you can beat BYD with that. You need real expertise.” BYD has vertical integration with the batteries. Its batteries are 30 percent cheaper than what we can buy from CATL. For us to beat that battery, to even be in the neighborhood in terms of cost, we have to radically redesign the efficiency of the motors, gearboxes, and inverters on the EV side so it uses 30 percent less battery. We can’t beat BYD’s vertical integration on the cost of battery. The only way we can beat it was with innovation on the draw of the battery. When I got the list of inventory from Doug about what we have to do to beat BYD, even three to four years ago, it became very obvious to me that I had to look my team in the eyes and say, “Eventually we’re going to come back to you for the industrialization of this product. But for now, leave these people alone, trust that they don’t have any prejudice in coming up with something better. If you want to get mad at me, you can come into my office and shout at me, but don’t waste their time.” I talked to Bill, and I also do Gemba. I go in person for every big decision I ever make. I went to that teardown and looked at every piece. I looked at the number of fasteners in a Model Y. It was literally a third of the fasteners that go into a Mach-E. From a customer standpoint, you won’t tell the difference, but from manufacturability and cost standpoints, fasteners are an output metric for how elegant your engineering solution is. When I looked at those fasteners and the wiring loom, I knew I had no choice because I gemba walked and talked to people who knew. I can’t put the company’s future at risk by making people happy. I have to do the right thing. That’s how I approached that particular decision. Can I interrupt you quickly to tell me what gemba is? Gemba is something that I fell in love with at Toyota. Gemba is “genchi genbutsu,” which is a Japanese phrase for “go and see with your own eyes, learn with your own eyes.” It’s actually the five senses. The idea is that before you make a big decision or want to understand a problem, you have to go and see the real problem and where the waste is. It’s a tool in problem solving. In my case, the waste was that wiring harness, those fasteners, all the welds, the front and rear structures that’ll eventually get displaced by unicasting. You see the waste. You look at it, you ask the engineers: “Why do we have this waste? Why do we use a 25-year-old parts release system?” As a leader, you get down on the floor and you ask them the basic questions, so you can visualize your decision. That’s what gemba is. Love that. Didn’t know that before. I need to practice gemba, clearly. Let me back up here. You have to restructure your company, but it also seems like you’ve been talking about restructuring the economy. You’ve been talking about a refocus on the “Essential Economy,” or the blue-collar jobs that are the backbone of this country. You wrote a LinkedIn essay in June about the focus of AI on white-collar productivity, but that we need to do the same for blue-collar work. How are you thinking about automation at Ford? There’s a complete crisis in the country that’s not being talked about. People like Mike Rowe will talk about it, but we have a crisis that’s not in the public debate. We have a 500,000 construction worker shortfall. We have a 500,000 factory worker shortfall. We don’t have enough people in emergency services to support our society when things go wrong. Firemen, ambulance workers, medical workers, plumbers, and electricians — the frontline people that make our society run that many of us take for granted.We call this the Essential Economy. We see this at Ford because we’re on the edge of this software-defined vehicle, but we’re also a heavy manufacturing industrial company. Whether it’s a technician shortage in our dealerships to work on these vehicles or the factory worker shortage, I really learned as a leader during the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike what a crisis we have as a country. I see it with our customers. Plumbers and electricians are constantly trying to get young people into those vocations, and there’s no training. The trade schools and apprentice programs that our grandparents had that made this country so great are not there anymore. We’re very vulnerable as a country. The productivity of those essential workers, as you said, is way behind that of white-collar workers. Automation, AI deployment, and everything else that has happened for white-collar tools, it’s not the same for blue-collar work. There’s very little training. Companies like Ford, thankfully, have enough resources that we can put our backs behind this problem with trade schools and scholarships, but our society isn’t doing it. In fact, we’re going to have a conference here in Detroit in the fall where we’re going to gather other companies that have the same problem and really see it — solution providers, academics, and creative people in government — and we’re going to try and start working on this problem. Is it a Farm Aid or medical crisis like COVID? No, it’s more. In a way, it’s just as threatening to our society. The way we’re thinking about it is that we’re going to walk the walk and invest heavily. We have been. We spent about $1 billion on the dignity of the workplace and safety in our plants. We’ve modernized our buildings. We’re investing in trade schools and scholarships to recruit technicians for vehicle repair as well as our factories. But this is a society problem. The one that bothers me the most is cultural. We, as a culture, think that everyone has to go to an Ivy League school to be valuable in our society, yet we all know that our parents and grandparents made our country wonderful because of these kinds of jobs. There’s incredible dignity in emergency services, and people can have wonderful careers. But our society doesn’t celebrate those people like they do the latest AI engineer. That’s exactly what I wanted to ask you. This seems like such a reversal of decades of messaging in America that said “Get out of manufacturing and go to the office.” Is your advice to this next generation to actually go get a job in manufacturing? I think it would help all of us as a society. Look, my son [Jameson] is 17. He’s a senior in high school. He’s got every opportunity that you could ever imagine. He doesn’t have to worry like most people. I made sure that he had a summer job where he learned how to weld, to fabricate, to really work with his hands, and relate to people. And he can make a choice. I have no prejudice for Jameson. If he turns out to be the greatest welder or a mechanic working on our Super Duty diesel engines, I will be so thrilled as a parent. I think we all need to look at ourselves and decide what kind of society we want to build in America. Let’s say that we’re getting into war somewhere. Google’s not going to make the boots, but Ford will. To defend our own country, we need these people. Now, we’re having critical issues. The average ambulance is 15 years old. We do not have enough emergency care people. Look at what firemen are having to go through in California with smoke and their own health. These are very dangerous jobs, and we have a shortage. It’s going to affect all of us in a lot of annoying ways. We need to really get serious about readjusting our expectations for our kids, younger people, and our country to give them opportunities to grow. And these are great jobs. A factory job at Ford could make way over $100,000 a year, and you can bridge into a lot of other things. My grandfather was a factory worker at Ford, and he became a Ford dealer in his 60s. Think about the possibility. He was an orphan, he had nothing. He never went to college. It didn’t matter to him. I’m really excited and energized about this. It’s a much bigger problem than fixing Ford and making it a world-class company. It’s important for our country. We need to focus on this just as much as the new exciting AI and the new social media dance on Instagram. Let’s get busy working on these important problems. I do have a call-in question from a guest caller. Nilay Patel: Hey, Jim, it’s Nilay. I’m very excited to be calling in with this question. As you know, I’m a Mustang guy. I have a 2021 Mustang GT convertible. It’s one of my favorite cars ever. People love this car because it’s so easy to mod and tune. You can just reprogram the engine control unit (ECU) to make the car go faster. But with the new version of the gas Mustang, the one with all the screens running on your new platform, the ECUs are locked. People can’t just reprogram them. A lot of enthusiasts attribute the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales to the locked ECUs. My questions are: Do you agree with that, that the locked ECUs are behind the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales? Do you have a plan to let people unlock the ECUs and tune the car more easily? Thanks for answering the question. Joanna, I’m sure you’re doing a great job. I have no idea what that question means. So– [Laughs] I do. I’m going to set a timer. You get a minute to answer that. I have this debate with my son, actually, because he has an older Mustang. He didn’t buy the new one for reasons like that. I would absolutely say the drop in sales is not due to that. Actually, we’re doing really well with Mustang. I think we’re the only one left really, which we’re quite proud of. We’re investing a lot in Mustang. I think the thing people don’t get about Mustang is that it’s a global car. It’s the best-selling sports coupe in the world. We outsell Mustang outside of the US than inside the US. When I look at sales for Mustang, I look at globally. The Mustang continues to grow in some of our biggest countries like Australia and Sweden because people want a little slice of that America. Everyone wants to do a burnout. As far as the vehicle’s tunability, I think the call-in question is outstanding. This is a real dilemma for us, and there’s no easy answer. We want people to modify their cars, but we also have to take quality and privacy really seriously. I think he was talking more about the performance of the vehicle, and over time, our approach would be to give people the option to digitally adjust their vehicle from Ford, so that we can maintain quality but still let the user have their own idea of performance. That’s different for everyone, and I think that vision will come to life in the coming years. The aftermarket is a real opportunity, but it’s also a big challenge for us because a lot of people like to write software in the control module that controls the powertrain to get better performance. But what they don’t know, and what the user may not be aware of, is that all the reliability and the quality issues that might come up are very expensive. My daughter’s boyfriend is one of these people. He bought a brand new F-150, he’s got a supercharger on it. He recently got a bunch of error codes because he updated the ECU against Ford’s standards, and now he needs thousands of dollars of expensive repairs because the vehicle has started chewing its camshaft. It was great that he could get 650 horsepower out of his EcoBoost F-150. He didn’t think about what he was doing to the reliability of the vehicle, but we have to at Ford. All I would say is that it’s a tough problem to solve. We always want to give customers a chance to tune their vehicles, but we actually know a lot about the reliability of the vehicle. Are we as a brand going to let our quality reputation suffer to give a person the ability to modify the vehicle? I think that’s a hard compromise for us to make. I actually understood most of it. I want to move on to the big T in the room: the tariffs. Last quarter, you operated at a loss despite record revenue because you took $800 million in tariff charges in Q2, when tariffs were actually lower than they are now. What are your conversations like right now with the administration? They’re very important. Ford is the most American company in terms of the quantity of vehicles we make in the US. Over 80 percent of our vehicles sold here are made here. But we also are the largest importer of parts. The discussion we’re having with the administration today covers three policy areas: tailpipe emissions, tax policy, and especially tariffs. On tariffs, the biggest issue is the $2 billion bill for our imported parts. Because we make the most in the US, we import the most parts. We have a lot of stackable tariffs. There’s fentanyl tariffs, [Section 301 tariffs] from China. We have steel and aluminum tariffs that are now over 50 percent. There are a lot of tariffs that a company like Ford gets because there are auto-specific tariffs and non-auto-specific tariffs. They all stack up. So, we have this layering of all these imported parts. To make an F-150 affordable, there are a lot of parts we can’t make locally, like wiring looms and fasteners. There are thousands and thousands of parts that we have to import because we can’t even buy them in the US. If we did, the vehicle would be $100 to $200 a month too expensive for customers. Our discussions with Washington, D.C. are really clear: “Look, we both agree. Let’s strengthen US companies like Ford that have bet on America. We have more UAW jobs than anyone, but don’t penalize us for trying to make the vehicle affordable.” We’ve had very productive discussions with the Department of Commerce, the president himself, and the whole administration on how to come up with a way to minimize this $2 billion bill so that we are advantaged as a company. Originally, they were thinking that there would be high tariffs for finished automotive vehicles. Fifty percent of all vehicles bought in the US are imported through a port or a rail across a border. Now, it looks like the standard tariff will be about 15 percent and 12.5 percent from Japan. That’s not a fair fight. We’re just asking for a fair fight. If you’re going to allow people to import with 15 percent tariffs, which includes their parts in the vehicle, but you put a 50, 60, 70 percent tariff on the aluminum steel that goes into our US-made vehicle, let’s work on a process for tariff relief that would allow us to do that and still make the vehicles affordable. That’s what we’re talking about with the administration. They’re extremely open, and they’re extremely supportive of us. They’re also making a lot of policy changes on tailpipe emissions and tax. Look at the EV credits as an example. We can get to that if you want. But the tariffs are the most critical for our profitability. About 20 percent of our profit has evaporated now because of these parts tariffs. We’re highly engaged with the administration. I remain very optimistic that we will find a solution, but it is very expensive. I wanted to ask about the EV credits because between the tariffs and the EV credits going away, it feels like this administration is on your side. Yet, you are also adding more jobs than ever to manufacturing here in the US. You’re doing the things the president wants. Yes. I do generally believe that those three policy areas are very important. Joanna, we didn’t feel like we should get a $7,500 check on an EV to make the transition successful. We do need support for the production tax credit on batteries, so that we could be competitive with China because it has such a huge advantage, and we do need to onshore that IP to start really scaling battery manufacture. You can’t ship a battery overseas. It’s very heavy and it’s not a good shipper, which we say as a shipper. We have gotten a lot of support from them for making batteries here in the US. The PTC credit is very important. We have changed our EV investment to not depend on the consumer tax credit from the government, and we’re fine with that. Other countries like China and in Europe do support their EV consumers. We didn’t really expect that at Ford. We’re kind of a “lift ourselves up by the bootstraps” kind of company anyway, so that was something we already did. But the relief on fuel economy standards is a very important topic that the administration clearly has a point of view on. We want one national standard, and we want to be able to sell what customers really want. Hybrids are really popular now, and so are EVs. I think we’ll find a tailpipe emission standard that is more reasonable and sustainable and not have a bunch of states with unique standards that make logistics for cars a nightmare, since you have to send different states different emission-standard cars. And that’s really expensive for customers, too. The real area that is super critical for Ford and for companies like Ford that are committed to the US, is tariffs, working through and making adjustments as they and bilateral trade deals get announced. We need to find a landing spot that works for companies like Ford, where it’s a level playing field from a tariff standpoint and the administration accomplishes what it wants to accomplish. We’re not there yet, and that’s why we’re working really hard. I spent a lot of time in DC, and there’s a good reason for it. This is really important for our factory workers, for the future of our country, and for the shareholders of Ford. I want to come back to me because really this whole podcast is about me, obviously. [Laughs] Good. One of the main reasons I decided to get the Mach-E, other than it having good range and me loving the way it drives, was that it had Apple CarPlay. Some of your competitors have abandoned CarPlay. A lot of the newer, upstart car companies, like Rivian and Tesla, have their own software. I want to talk about this new Digital Experience you guys are working on, but I want to just cut to the chase with CarPlay. What about CarPlay Ultra? Are you considering that? We are. We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one, but we’re very committed to Apple. I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car. We want you, Joanna, and all the customers to bring in their digital life, and make it as easy as possible. We don’t think we should restrict that to make money off the customers. We don’t want it to be a hassle. We don’t think we can design an experience that’s going to displace your phone. At the same time, there are things that Ford is working on to add on top of the Google and CarPlay digital experience, whether it’s automated systems or the way a trip gets planned, that will make it even better. We’re highly informed by what’s going on in China right now, specifically the customer experience part. An AI assistant in the car, let’s say, is very important for Ford. We think that every customer should have an AI assistant in the car. Not just a voice to move to your phone-based AI system but something specific that you can talk to, almost like a companion. To allow everyone to bring their digital life into the car and have it seamlessly integrated is a more complicated journey for us to execute. Then, put more on top of that, whether it’s productivity software (we’re now up to 1 million Ford Pro subscriptions now), BlueCruise, how you plan a trip, or auto specific things like how your [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] (ADAS) system works and how it integrates into your entertainment system. We believe we have to design something that works with your digital life as well. It’s a more complicated choice, especially when you look at backcasting it into all of our past vehicles, but I believe it’s a more customer-centric approach. And you will see that, Joanna, in your next shopping trip. You’ll make that choice, we’ll all read about it. That’s our philosophy. Now, other companies have different philosophies, but we believe that our philosophy is the most customer-centric. But it seems like with the Ford Digital Experience, which you have rolled out to some cars and is based on Android Automotive, that you’re going to have to choose. Are you going to do this Android Automotive experience with the things you’re talking about building on top, or are you going to pick a CarPlay Ultra experience and go all on Apple? I see what you mean. It’s a really good question. I don’t know where Apple’s going to go. I think Apple has to make a big decision. It’s not a Ford decision, actually. Then, we will decide based on their decision. You mean that Apple has to make a decision, or are you going to allow this to also run in combination with other infotainment software? Yes. Not only that, are you going to allow OEMs to control the vehicles? How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access? We’re doing that now for our Pro customers. If you’re a Pro customer, you can limit access to the vehicle on the weekend. Many of our plumbers and electricians have a company vehicle and they’re not allowed to use it on the weekend. We allow speed control now, so you can’t go above the speed limit. Is Apple going to want to do that? If Apple wants to do that, I think we’re going to have a tough time because then the Digital Experience gets really messy, and we’ll have to decide between Google and Apple, to your point. Now, Google has two different layers. It has Google Automotive Services, which is a curated digital services experience in the car, but it also has Android Auto, which is an operating system that we can build our own experience on top of. So, Google as a platform company gives us both. Apple has a totally different approach. Again, I’ve talked to the Apple team and our team is in contact with them. I think Apple has to decide if it wants control of the entire experience inside a vehicle. If it does and it wants to follow Ultra with the Ultra 2 or whatever is next, then Ford will have to make a big decision. I know where we would go. We believe ADAS integration with your entertainment system is so critical. In three or four years when you’re flying down the highway with your eyes off the road going 80 miles an hour on Interstate 5 and you’re watching a movie, having a ChatGPT moment, or having a wearable on, we don’t think that a system from a tech company that’s not integrated into the car is going to save your life. So we’ll have to make a choice. It sounds to me that you’ve been forced with the reality that you’ve got to build your own. Yes, but the good thing is that now versus when you and I last talked, Android Auto is advancing nicely. We’ve learned a lot about how to build an experience on that. I hear a lot of OEMs say, “Well, it’s about controlling the customer. I don’t want Apple to be able to...” That’s not a big deal for us. We just want it to be easy for customers. But if those companies want to control the vehicle, I think that’s a bridge too far. In that case, we have to invest a lot more in a Ford experience. I hope that doesn’t happen, by the way. I look at what has happened with Huawei and Xiaomi in China. It’s amazing. Those companies are all in on auto. When you’re a Huawei or Xiaomi customer, you either buy a Huawei system in someone else’s brand or you buy a Xiaomi car, and it’s completely seamless. I wish our tech companies had approached the auto industry that way, but they haven’t. Now we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do. You said something really interesting about how you want to have an AI companion in the car. I am actually spending a lot of time in the car now talking to ChatGPT. I’m not listening to Decoder. I have my iPhone, it’s coming through CarPlay, it’s Bluetooth paired, and I’ve got my ChatGPT app. I’m not looking at it, it’s safe. I just have it in voice mode and I’m driving to a meeting to meet you. I’ll say, “Tell me what I should know about Jim Farley and where he’s been in the news.” It’s a very interactive conversation, almost like I’m on the phone. How do you think about this? Does Ford have to be a part of that relationship? It’s a good question. I think, yes, especially for anything transportation-related. I want to go somewhere, I want to know about my car and the condition of the car. We either have to be part of the conversation or we have to supply that. Not to be arrogant because of the safety control and the vehicle control, but we actually think we can provide a chat experience that has added value beyond your non-vehicle experience. To your point, we don’t want to burden the customer with two different experiences. That would be really arrogant and really bad for the company. I think people are starting to realize why you’ve been on this, Joanna. The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that. We have to sort this out really thoughtfully. Now, in China, Nio has an AI companion in the car. It’s like a physical thing. It’s like a little person, and it works really well. Customers love it. If you look at China being ahead of the West in terms of integrating AI as a companion in your vehicle, early indications are that a well done companion-like functionality from the OEMcan add a lot of value to people’s lives. That’s the direction we’re going. It’s similar to not investing in Level 4 autonomy and robotaxis and putting our effort towards Level 3 automated, eyes-off driving in the AI space. It’s a similar kind of bet. Pick a few places where Ford can add value, but don’t make the customer go backwards. That’s our philosophy. To be clear , you’re more focused on that highway driving experience right now with BlueCruise? For sure. Our number one priority is to not be the first one to do eyes-off, Level 3highway driving, but to be the best, most reliable, and the safest, the one you want to use for you and your loved ones. We took all the Argo AI people and we gave them a choice. Do you want to do highway high speed, eyes-off automation? Push a button, watch a movie, or whatever people want to do? We could do this podcast in your car. All of our AI deployment for autonomous driving is going there because we think that’s a cooler problem to solve for most average Americans than a robotaxi. Even though the robotaxi is a really cool problem — I love being in a Waymo — we think that highway miles are a bigger societal opportunity. Alright, my last question. You get to play car salesman. It’s next August, I got to get rid of this Mach-E. What do I do? Oh, you need to buy another Mach-E. We’ve improved it a lot since your last one. It’s a lot more affordable. We have some wonderful new experiences. I’m going to give you a run for your money in terms of value. It’s a really incredible product that we’ve refined over four years. The Mach-E’s we’re making now are pretty radically different from the earlier ones. We have OTA updated your car, and I know what improvements were in that. The new vehicle, the compute power onboard, the efficiency, the quality, and the improvements to the fit and finish are all material enough that I think you should test-drive one and see what we have. There’s a reason why we just beat the revised Model Y, which is the best-selling alternative — not that you would just use that as your benchmark. I think you’re going to have a lot of fun shopping. I’m going to learn a lot as you go shopping, like the rest of America. What I would love for you to do is wait six months because I want to show you this new Universal car. You’re going to go, “Jim, I’m so glad you told me to wait.” That’s what you can do for me. You can give me an extension on the lease. This is what you should have been doing for me. This is where I would’ve sold me. I would’ve said, “Extension on the lease, six months, we’re going to give you a good deal Joanna. You’re going to be happy.” And bridge you to something that no one will be able to offer. You’ll go, “Oh, my god, this is so much better than anything I could buy, including the Mach-E. I’m really glad I waited.” That’s the right approach. See, I should be working in your dealership. That’s how I would’ve sold it. Well, Jim Farley, thank you so much for spending so much time. I’ve got a ton more questions, but we’ll do this again sometime and have you back on the show. I don’t think you’re driving a dinosaur either. I think you’re driving a fantastic automobile. I love my Mach-E. Frankly, we’re really proud to have you as the owner, and thank you for being on the podcast. I always enjoy our interaction. I can’t wait to learn more about the ChatGPT experience inside your car. I hope you don’t mind if a few of our software engineers call you. Yeah, they should call me. Again, this is not sponsored. I have been a very happy Mach-E driver. I’ve been in it a lot this summer. We didn’t get to it, but the charging infrastructure has improved so much. I charge for 30 minutes at Electrify America, and Electrify America has gotten better. Get that CEO on here. I charge, I’m on my way. I drove 350 miles up to New Hampshire last week. Oh good. I’ve been happy. We’ve got some software things to deal with. We didn’t really get into that, but it sounds like you’re working on it for me. We are. That you for the time, Joanna. All the best to you. You too. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!

    "title": "Get Keychron fantastic V1 mechanical keyboard for just $45",
    "text": "Keychron is one of the biggest names in mechanical keyboards (but certainly far from the only maker worthy of your attention). If you’re interested in an upgrade for your desk, or just an additional keyboard to use during gaming or intensive typing, Woot has great deals running on a fleet of wired and wireless models, some of which have hot-swappable switches. Keychron mechanical keyboards are up to 62 percent off Other standout deals include $150 off the Pixel Watch 3, and some RTX 5060 Ti 16GB models selling at $369.99. Other standout deals include $150 off the Pixel Watch 3, and some RTX 5060 Ti 16GB models selling at $369.99. Currently, Woot’s selection runs the gamut of colors and sizes, with full-size options in the K10 Wireless (was $114.99, now $54.99) and the V6 wired model (was $99.99, now $49.99). For something more ergonomically-friendly, you can opt for the Q8 or Q10 keyboards, which are around 60 percent off their original prices. For a great, compact 75 percent wired keyboard with hot-swappable switches, look no further than the V1, which is $44.99. Keychron V1 The Keychron V1 is as much a comfortable keyboard as it is a productivity tool, one with remappable keys and hot swappable switches to better suit your workflow. It’s also a lot more stylish than your average keyboard, with slick RGB backlighting and double-shot PBT keycaps. Other deals to keep your Monday going - Google’s Pixel Watch 4 is on the horizon, launching October 9th at $349.99 for the 41mm size and $399.99 for the 45mm size. There are always going to be people who want the latest gadgets, and those who take advantage of the moment to score a deal on the last-gen product. If you find yourself if the latter bucket, head over to Amazon where you can get the 41mm Wi-Fi version of the Pixel Watch 3 in the champagne gold aluminum case for $199.99. It’s a good smartwatch, even though it’s missing out on some new hardware features. For instance, its glass and display isn’t as domed as the Pixel Watch 4, nor does it have the Satellite SOS that’s coming to the new LTE version. And, it’s not as repairable as Google claims the latest model will be. But, it has many of the same software features. - If you’re into hiking or you live off the grid, you might want something more capable and helpful for your winding journey than a smartwatch or smartphone. Garmin’s inReach Mini 2 is a satellite message communicator and tracking device in one. It can last for up to 14 days per charge (or more, depending on tracking preferences), and it’s rated for high durability, with both MIL-STD-810 and IPX7 ratings. Originally $399.99, you can get it in red or black at Amazon, Best Buy, or through Garmin directly for $249.99. The device can handle two-way messaging, turn-by-turn navigation (with TrakBack routing to go back the way you came), real-time location sharing, and more. However, a monthly subscription is required to take advantage of the inReach Mini 2’s satellite features, starting at $7.99 per month. - If you’re looking for a good deal on a new desktop GPU, Micro Center’s deals on certain Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti overclocked models with 16GB of VRAM are the best we’ve seen yet. Both the MSI and Zotac dual fan models with double the amount of base memory (making them the superior value versus 8GB models) are just $369.99 when you pick up in-store. The RTX 5060 Ti is a great option for those who are content playing games at 1080p resolution. You may be able to play some titles at 1440p or higher, but that’ll likely require you to enable Nvidia graphical features that boost game performance, including DLSS and multi-frame generation.",

    "title": "Microsoft launches  vibe working  in Excel and Word",
    "text": "You’ve probably heard of vibe coding — novices writing apps by creating a simple AI prompt — but now Microsoft wants to introduce a similar thing for its Office apps. The software maker is launching a new Agent Mode in Excel and Word that can generate complex spreadsheets and documents with just a prompt. A new Office Agent in Copilot chat, powered by Anthropic models, is also launching today that can create PowerPoint presentations and Word documents from a “vibe working” chatbot. Microsoft launches ‘vibe working’ in Excel and Word A new Agent Mode comes to Office apps today, alongside an Office Agent in Copilot chat. A new Agent Mode comes to Office apps today, alongside an Office Agent in Copilot chat. “Today we’re bringing vibe working to Microsoft 365 Copilot with Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat,” says Sumit Chauhan, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Office Product Group. “In the same way vibe coding has transformed software development, the latest reasoning models in Copilot unlock agentic productivity for Office artifacts.” Agent Model in Excel and Word is a more powerful version of the Copilot experience that Microsoft has added to its Office apps. It’s designed to make the complex parts of Excel more accessible to users that aren’t experts. “It’s not just simple assistive short answers, but board-ready presentations or documents,” Chauhan says. “It’s work, quite frankly, that a first-year consultant would do, delivered in minutes.” Agent Mode essentially takes a complex task and breaks it down with planning and reasoning that you can follow. It then uses OpenAI’s GPT-5 model to break down each step of document creation into an agentic task and execute it. It’s like watching an automated macro in real time, showing everything it’s doing in the sidebar. Microsoft has taken a gradual approach to adding AI elements to Excel, particularly because the data it handles powers some of the most important parts of businesses worldwide. “[Agent Mode] lets you build sheets that are auditable, refreshable, and verifiable,” Chauhan says. “We have spent a ton of time making sure that the validation loop on all of these sub-agents is pretty tight.” Microsoft says its Agent Mode in Excel has an accuracy rate of 57.2 percent in SpreadsheetBench, a benchmark for evaluating an AI model’s ability to edit real world spreadsheets. This result places Agent Mode above Shortcut.ai, ChatGPT agent with .xlsx support, and Claude Files Opus 4.1. It’s still behind the human accuracy of 71.3 percent, though. Agent Mode in Word goes beyond the existing writing, rewrite, and summarization AI features in Word. “Agent Mode in Word turns document creation into vibe writing, an interactive, conversational experience,” Chauhan says. It lets Copilot draft content, suggest refinements, and clarify what elements are needed during the process of document creation. You can do things like create a monthly report with data from previous months and have Copilot summarize the highlights for the month and the differences from a previous report. “Copilot makes suggestions to keep the process flowing, so writing feels more like a dialogue than a task,” Chauhan says. Microsoft’s new Office Agent will also be available outside of its Office apps via Copilot chat. Powered by Anthropic models, it can create full PowerPoint presentations or Word documents from a chat prompt. “PowerPoint is one of the most used tools for creating presentations, but over the last two years AI has often fallen short when creating slides,” Chauhan says. “Office Agent changes that.” Office Agent can create fully structured PowerPoint decks, all while doing web-based research and providing a live preview of slides. Microsoft is hoping that it will help Office continue to differentiate itself from the magnitude of AI tools that are also trying to create documents, spreadsheets, and slide decks. “Productivity is our DNA, we’re Office,” Chauhan says. “While others will try to replicate us, there is no substitute for the real thing.” Office Agent also marks another entry point for Anthropic AI models in Microsoft 365 apps and services. Microsoft already embraced the OpenAI rival to improve researcher, GitHub Copilot, and Copilot Studio recently, and now Anthropic’s AI models are able to produce Word and PowerPoint documents from Microsoft’s own Copilot chat interface. ”We are committed to OpenAI, but we are starting to explore with the model family to understand the strength that different models bring and understand how we build the best composition for our products,” Chauhan says. “We are looking at the entire family of models, wherever cutting edge work happens.” While OpenAI models continue to power Microsoft’s AI work inside Office apps, it certainly feels like Anthropic’s models are inching closer to being a key part of Office apps like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Microsoft is using Anthropic’s API to bring these features to Copilot chat, which runs on cloud rival Amazon Web Services. That could be why we haven’t seen Anthropic’s AI models deeply woven into desktop Office apps yet. Agent Mode in Copilot for Excel and Word will both be available today in the Frontier program for Microsoft 365 Copilot customers or Microsoft 365 Personal / Family subscribers. Agent Model in Excel and Word is only available in the web versions at launch, with desktop support coming soon. Office Agent is also available today in the Frontier program for Microsoft 365 Copilot customers or Microsoft 365 Personal / Family subscribers in the US.",

    "text": "Anker announced its new capacious Prime Power Bank (26k, 300W) at IFA 2025 as part of a larger collection of updated Prime series charging devices. At the time, pricing wasn’t known, but the power bank is now available through Anker’s online store and Amazon for $229.99 with a temporary discount to $184 for the next six days. Anker’s fastest airline-friendly power bank is now available The company is offering a temporary discount on its $229.99 Prime Power Bank (26k, 300W) first announced at IFA 2025. The company is offering a temporary discount on its $229.99 Prime Power Bank (26k, 300W) first announced at IFA 2025. The Prime Power Bank’s 26,250mAh capacity (99.75Wh at 3.8V) keeps it airline-friendly and below the TSA’s 100 watt-hours limit for devices in carry-on luggage. It features a pair of USB-C ports that can each output up to 140W of power simultaneously so you can charge two laptops, even if they happen to be a pair of power-hungry 16-inch MacBook Pros. And with a total power output of 300W you can also add a smartphone to the mix and charge it at 20W using an additional USB-A port while your laptops are powering up. Those USB-C ports are bi-directional, and when both are connected to a pair of 140W USB-C PD 3.1 chargers, the Prime Power Bank itself can charge at up to 250W, taking it from dead to 80 percent in about 35 minutes, Anker claims. You can monitor power input and output using the battery’s built-in screen, or through Anker’s mobile app while it’s connected to your smartphone over Bluetooth. At $179.99 you can actually get more capacity from EcoFlow’s Rapid Pro Power Bank 27k for less money. At 27,650mAh it slightly edges out Anker’s and will charge slightly faster when connected to a pair of 140W USB-C PD 3.1 chargers. EcoFlow also includes a built-in retractable USB-C cable, but at 699 grams the Rapid Pro Power Bank 27k is slightly heavier and bulkier than Anker’s Prime Power Bank (26k, 300W) which weighs in at 600 grams. If you’re trying to pack light…ish while traveling, Anker’s could be worth the splurge. Also now available through the company’s online store and Amazon is the Anker Prime Charger that debuted alongside the new power bank at IFA 2025. It’s $149.99, temporarily discounted to $120, and features a trio of USB-C ports that can each output up to 140W – although the charger’s total output is limited to up to 210W. Power use can be monitored through a tiny built-in display or wirelessly using Anker’s mobile app.",
